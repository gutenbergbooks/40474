<p class="centerb">ELEVENTH LECTURE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> this Lecture I shall submit to your consideration
some criticisms on the prevailing
method of treating the History of our Art;
attended by a series of observations on the
magnificent picture of the Last Supper, by
Lionardo da Vinci, now before you.</p>

<p>History, mindless of its real object, sinking
to Biography, has been swelled into a diffuse
catalogue of individuals, who, tutored by different
schools, or picking something from the
real establishers of Art, have done little more
than repeat, or imitate through the medium
of either, what those had found in Nature, discriminated,
selected, and applied to Art, according
to her dictates. Without wishing to
depreciate the merit of that multitude who
felt, proved themselves strong enough, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
strenuously employed life to follow, it must be
pronounced below the historian's dignity to
allow them more than a transitory glance.
Neither originality, nor selection and combination
of materials scattered over the various
classes of Art by others, have much right to
attention from him who only investigates the
real progress of Art, if the first proves to have
added nothing essential to the system by novelty,
and the second to have only diluted energy,
and by a popular amalgama to have pleased the
vulgar. Novelty, without enlarging the circle
of knowledge, may delight or strike, but is
nearer allied to whim than to invention; and
an eclectic system, without equality of parts, as
it originated in want of comprehension, totters
on the brink of mediocrity.</p>

<p>The first ideas of Expression, Character,
Form, Chiaroscuro, and Colour, originated in
Tuscany: Masaccio, Lionardo da Vinci, M.
Agnolo, Bartolomeo della Porta. The first was
carried off before he could give more than hints
of dramatic composition; the second appears to
have established character on physiognomy, and
to have seen the first vision of chiaroscuro,
though he did not penetrate the full extent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
its charm; the third had power, knowledge,
and life sufficiently great, extensive, and long,
to have fixed style on its basis, had not an
irresistible bias drawn off his attention from
the modesty and variety of Nature; Baccio
gave amplitude to drapery, and colour to form.</p>

<p>Of the Tuscan School that succeeded these,
the main body not only added nothing to their
discoveries, but, if their blind attachment to
the singularities rather than the beauties of
the third be excepted, equally inattentive to
expression, character, propriety of form, the
charms of chiaroscuro, and energies of colour,
contented themselves to give to tame or puerile
ideas, obvious and common-place conceptions,
a kind of importance by mastery of execution
and a bold but monotonous and always mannered
outline; and though Andrea del Sarto,
with Francia Bigio, Giacopo da Pontormo, and
Rosso, may be allowed to have thought sometimes
for themselves and struck out paths of
their own, will it be asserted that they enlarged
or even filled the circle traced out before?
The most characteristic work of Andrea's original
powers, is, no doubt, the historic series in
S. Giovanni dei Scalzi; yet, when compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
with the patriarchal simplicity of the groups
in the Lunette of the Sistine Chapel, the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of his characters and imagery will be
found too much tainted with contemporary,
local, and domestic features, for Divine, Apostolic,
and Oriental agents. His drapery, whenever
he escapes from the costume of the day,
combines with singular felicity the breadth of
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Frati</i>, and the acute angles of Albert
Durer; but neither its amplitude, nor the
solemn repose and tranquillity of his scenery,
can supply the want of personal dignity, or
consecrate vulgar forms and trivial features.</p>

<p>The Roman school like an Oriental sun rose,
not announced by dawn, and, setting, left no
twilight. Raffaello established his school on
the Drama; its scenery, its expression, its
forms; History, Lyrics, Portrait, became under
his hand the organs of passion and character.
With his demise the purity of this principle
vanished. Julio Romano, too original to adopt,
formed a school of his own at Mantoua, which,
as it was founded on no characteristic principle,
added nothing to Art, and did not long survive
its founder. Polydoro Caldara was more ambitious
to emulate the forms of the antique than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to propagate the style of his master, which was
not comprehended by Penny, called Il Fattore,
mangled by Perrino del Vaga, became common-place
in the hands of the Zuccari, barbarous
manner during the usurpation of Giuseppe
Cesari, sunk to tameness in the timid
imitation of Sacchi and Maratta, and expired
under the frigid method of Mengs.</p>

<p>A certain national, though original character,
marks the brightest epoch of the Venetian
School. However deviating from each other,
Tiziano, Tintoretto, Jacopo da Ponte, and
Paolo Veronese, acknowledge but one element
of imitation, Nature herself: this principle
each bequeathed to his school, and no attempt
to adulterate its simplicity by uniting different
methods, distinguishes their immediate successors:
hence they preserved features of originality
longer than the surrounding schools,
whom the vain wish to connect incompatible
excellence, soon degraded to mediocrity, and
from that plunged to insignificance.</p>

<p>If what is finite could grasp infinity, the
variety of Nature might be united by individual
energy; till then the attempt to amalgamate
her scattered beauties by the imbecility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of Art, will prove abortive. Genius is the
pupil of Nature; perceives, is dazzled, and
imperfectly transmits one of her features: thus
saw M. Agnolo, Raffaello, Tiziano, Correggio;
and such were their technic legacies, as inseparable
from their attendant flaws, as in equal
degrees irreconcilable. That Nature is not
subject to decrepitude, is proved by the superiority
of modern over ancient science; what
hinders modern Art to equal that of classic
eras, is the effect of irremovable causes.</p>

<p>But I hasten to the principal object of this
Lecture, the consideration of the technic character
of Lionardo da Vinci, one, and in my
opinion the first of the great restorers of modern
Art, as deduced from his most important
work, the Last Supper, surviving as a whole in
the magnificent copy of Marco Uggione, rescued
from a random pilgrimage by the courage
and vigilance of our President, and by the
Academy made our own. The original of this
work, the ultimate test of his most vigorous
powers, the proof of his theory, and what may
be called with propriety the first characteristic
composition since the revival of the Art, was
the principal ornament of the Refectory in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the Dominican Convent of S. Maria delle
Gratie, at Milan.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the centre, the seat of the
principal figure, from which all the rest emanate
like rays. Sublimely calm, the face of the
Saviour broods over the immense, whilst every
face and every limb around him, roused by his
mysterious word, fluctuate in restless curiosity
and sympathetic pangs.</p>

<p>The face of the Saviour is an abyss of
thought, and broods over the immense revolution
in the economy of mankind, which throngs
inwardly on his absorbed eye&mdash;as the spirit
creative in the beginning over the water's darksome
wave&mdash;undisturbed and quiet. It could
not be lost in the copy before us: how could
its sublime conception escape those who saw
the original? It has survived the hand of
Time in the study which Lionardo made in
crayons, exhibited with most of the attendant
heads in the British Gallery; and even in the
feebler transcript of Del Testa.</p>

<p>I am not afraid of being under the necessity
of retracting what I am going to advance, that
neither during the splendid period immediately
subsequent to Lionardo, nor in those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
succeeded to our own time, has a face of the
Redeemer been produced which, I will not say
equalled, but approached the sublimity of Lionardo's
conception, and in quiet and simple features
of humanity embodied divine, or, what is
the same, incomprehensible and infinite powers.
To him who could contrive and give this combination,
the unlimited praise lavished on the
inferior characters who surround the hero,
whilst his success in that was doubted&mdash;appears
to me not only no praise, but a gross
injustice.</p>

<p>Yet such was the judgment of Vasari, and
in our days of Lanzi, both founded on the pretended
impossibility of transcribing the beauty
of forms and the varied energies of expression
distributed by the artist among the disciples.
"The moment," says Lanzi, and says well, "is
that in which the Saviour says to the Disciples,
"One of you will betray me!" On every one
of the innocent men the word acts like lightning:
he who is at a greater distance, distrusting
his own ears, applies to his neighbour;
others, according to their variety of character,
betray raised emotions. One of them faints,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
one is fixed in astonishment; this wildly rises,
the simple candour of another tells that he
cannot be suspected: Judas, meanwhile, assumes
a look of intrepidity, but, though he
counterfeits innocence, leaves no doubt of being
the traitor. Vinci used to tell, that for a year
he wandered about, perplexed with the thought
how to embody in one face the image of so
black a mind; and frequenting a village which
a variety of villains haunted, he met at last, by
the help of some associated features, with his
man. Nor was his success less conspicuous in
furnishing both the Jameses with congenial and
characteristic beauty; but being unable to find
an ideal superior to theirs for Christ, he left
the head, as Vasari affirms, imperfect, though
Arminine ascribes a high finish even to that."</p>

<p>Thus is the modesty and diffidence of the
artist, who, in the midst of the most glorious
success, always sought and wished for more,
brought as evidence against him by all his pretended
judges and critics, if we except the
single Bottari, who finds in it, with the highest
finish, all the fortitude of mind characteristic
of the Saviour, united to lively consideration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the suffering that awaited him&mdash;though even
that is, in my opinion, below the conception of
Lionardo.</p>

<p>Lest those who have read and recollect the
character of Lionardo which I have submitted
to the public, should, from the predilection
with which I have dwelt on what I think the
principal feature of his performance, the face
and attitude of the hero, suspect I shift my
ground, or charge me with inconsistency, I repeat
what I said then, when I was nearly unacquainted
with this work, that the distinguishing
feature of his powers lay in the
delineation of character, which he often raised
to a species, and not seldom degraded to caricature.
The triumphant proof of both is the
great performance before us; the same mind
that could unite divine power with the purest
humanity, by an unaccountable dereliction, not
only of the dignity due to his subject, but of
sound sense, thought it not beneath him to
haunt the recesses of deformity to unkennel a
villain. Did he confine villainy to deformity?
If he had, he would have disdained to give
him two associates in feature; for the face of
him who holds up his finger, and his who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
argues on the left extremity of the table, seem
to have proceeded, if not absolutely from the
same, from a very similar mould, yet they are
in the number of the elect, and, though on the
brink of caricature, have the air of good men.
Expression alone separates them from the
traitor, whom incapacity of remorse, hatred,
rage at being discovered, and habitual meanness,
seem to have divided into equal shares.</p>

<p>The portrait of Cesar Borgia, by Giorgione,
now hung up for your study in the Academy for
Painting, proves that the most atrocious mind
may lurk under good, sedate, and even handsome
features. Though his hand were not
drawing a dagger, who would expect mercy or
remorse from the evil methodized villainy of
that eye? But Judas was capable of remorse;
intolerant of the dreadful suffering with which
the horrid act had overwhelmed him, he rushed
on confession of his crime, restitution, and
suicide.</p>

<p>To the countenance and attitude of St. John,
blooming with youth, innocent, resigned, partaking
perhaps somewhat too much of the
feminine, and those of the two James's invigorated
by the strength of virility, energetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and bold, none will refuse a competent praise
of varied beauty; but they neither are nor
ought to be ideal, and had they been so, they
could neither compete nor interfere with the
sublimity that crowns the Saviour's brow, and
stamps his countenance with the God.</p>

<p>The felicity, novelty, and propriety of Lionardo's
conception and invention, are powerfully
seconded by every part of execution:&mdash;the
tone which veils and wraps actors and
scene into one harmonious whole, and gives it
breadth; the style of design, grand without
affectation, and, if not delicate or ideal, characteristic
of the actors; the draperies folded
with equal simplicity, elegance, and costume,
with all the propriety of presenting the highest
finish, without anxiety of touch, or thronging
the eye.</p>

<p>So artless is the assemblage of the figures,
that the very name of composition seems to
degrade what appears arranged by Nature's
own hand. That the nearest by relation, characters
and age, should be placed nearest the
master of the feast, and of course attract the
eye soonest, was surely the most natural arrangement;
but if they are conspicuous, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
are not so at the expense of the rest: distance
is compensated by action; the centre leads to
all, as all lead to the centre. That the great
restorer of light and shade sacrificed the effects
and charms of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaroscuro</i> at the shrine of
character, raised him at once above all his
future competitors; changes admiration to
sympathy, and makes us partners of the feast.</p>

<p>As expression sprang from the subject, so it
gave rise to competition. That Raffaello was
acquainted with Lionardo's work, and felt its
power, is evident from his composition, engraved
by M. Antonio: finding invention anticipated,
he took refuge in imitation, and filled
it with sentiments of his own; whether, beyond
the dignity of attitude, he attempts to
approach the profundity of Lionardo's Christ,
cannot, from a print of very moderate dimensions,
be decided. In the listening figure of
Judas, with equal atrocity of guilt he appears
to have combined somewhat more of apostolic
consequence.</p>

<p>The well-known Last Supper of the Loggia,
painted, or what is more probable, superintended
by Raffaello, is, by being made a night
scene, by contrast and chiaroscuro, become an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
original conception; but as it presents little
more than groups busy to arrange themselves
for sitting down or breaking up, it cannot
excite more interest than what is due to contrast
and effect, and active groups eager to
move yet not tumultuary.</p>

<p>But if Lionardo disdained to consult the
recesses of composition and the charms of artificial
chiaroscuro, he did not debase his work
to mere apposition: uniting the whole by tone,
he gave it substance by truth of imitation, and
effect by the disposition of the characters; the
groups flanking each side of the Saviour,
emerge, recede, and support each other with
a roundness, depth, and evidence which leave
all attempts at emendation or improvement
hopeless. But why should I attempt to enumerate
beauties which are before you, and
which if you do not perceive yourselves, no
words of mine can ever make you feel?</p>

<p>The universality of Lionardo da Vinci is
become proverbial: but though possessed of
every element, he rather gave glimpses than a
standard of form; though full of energy, he
had not powers effectually to court the various
graces he pursued. His line was free from
meagreness, and his forms presented volume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
but he appears not to have ever been much
acquainted, or to have sedulously sought much
acquaintance, with the Antique. Character
was his favourite study, and character he has
often raised from an individual to a species,
and as often depressed to caricature. The
strength of his execution lay in the delineation
of male heads; those of his females owe nearly
all their charms to chiaroscuro, of which he is
the supposed inventor: they are seldom more
discriminated than the children they fondle;
they are sisters of one family. The extremities
of his hands are often inelegant, though timorously
drawn, like those of Christ among the
Doctors in the picture we lately saw exhibited.
Lionardo da Vinci touched in every muscle of
his forms the master-key of the passion he
wished to express, but he is ideal only in
chiaroscuro.</p>

<p>Such was the state of the Art before the appearance
of M. Agnolo and Raffaello, and the
establishment of style.</p>

<p>Of M. Agnolo it is difficult to decide who
have understood less, his encomiasts or his critics,
though both rightly agree in dating from
him an epoch&mdash;those of the establishment, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of the subversion of Art.</p>

<p>It is the lot of Genius to be opposed, and to
be invigorated by opposition. All extremes
touch each other: frigid praise and frigid censure
wait on easily attainable or common powers:
but the successful adventurer in the realms
of Discovery, in spite of the shrugs, checks, and
sneers of the timid, the malign, and the envious,
leaps on an unknown or long lost shore, ennobles
it with his name, and grasps immortality.</p>

<p>M. Agnolo appeared, and soon discovered
that works worthy of perpetuity could neither
be built on defective and unsubstantial forms,
nor on the transient whim of fashion and local
sentiment; that their stamina were the real
stamina of Nature, the genuine feelings of humanity;
and planned for painting what Homer
had planned for poetry, the epic part, which,
with the utmost simplicity of a whole, should
unite magnificence of plan and endless variety
of subordinate parts. His line became generic,
but perhaps too uniformly grand: character and
beauty were admitted only as far as they could
be made subservient to grandeur. The child,
the female, meanness, deformity, were by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
indiscriminately stamped with grandeur. A
beggar rose from his hand the patriarch of poverty;
the hump of his dwarf is impressed with
dignity; his women are moulds of generation;
his infants teem with the man; his men are a
race of giants. This is the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">terribil via</span>," this
is that "magic circle," in which we are told that
none durst move but he. No, none but he
who makes sublimity of conception his element
of form. M. Agnolo himself offers the proof:
for the lines that bear in a mass on his mighty
tide of thought in the Gods and Patriarchs and
Sibyls of the Sistine Chapel, already too ostentatiously
show themselves in the Last Judgement,
and rather expose than support his ebbing
powers in the Chapel of Paul. Considered
as a whole, the Crucifixion of St. Peter and the
Conversion of Paul, in that place, are the dotage
of M. Agnolo's style; but they have parts
which make that dotage more enviable than the
equal vigour of mediocrity.</p>

<p>With what an eye M. Agnolo contemplated
the Antique, we may judge from his Bacchus,
the early production of his youth: in style it
is at least equal, perhaps in pulp and fleshiness
superior, to what is called the Antique Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Style. His idea seems to have been the personification
of youthful inebriety, but it is the
inebriety of a superior being, not yet forsaken
by grace, not yet relinquished by mind. In
more advanced years, the Torso of Apollonius
became his standard of form. But the D&aelig;mons
of Dante had too early tinctured his fancy to
admit in their full majesty the Gods of Homer
and of Phidias.</p>

<p>Such was the opinion formed of the plan and
style of M. Agnolo by the judges, the critics, the
poets, the artists, the public, of his own and
the following age, from Bembo to Ariosto, from
Raffaello to Tiziano, down to Agostino and
Annibale Carracci. Let us now compare it
with the technical verdict given by the greatest
professional critic, on the Continent, of our
times. "M. Agnolo," says Mengs, "seeking
always to be grand, was perhaps only bulky,
and by the perpetual use of a convex line, over-spanned
the forms and irrecoverably lost the
line of Nature. This charged style attended
him in his youth, and engrossed him when a
man. For this reason his works will always be
much inferior to the antique of the good style;
for though they made robust and muscular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
figures, they never made them heavy:&mdash;an instance
is the Hercules of Glycon, who, though
so bulky, and of form so majestic, is easily
seen to be swift like a stag, and elastic like a
ball. The style of M. Agnolo could not give
similar ideas, for the joints of his figures are too
contracted, and seem only made for the posture
into which he puts them. The forms of his
flesh are too round, his muscles of a mass and
shape always similar, which hides their springs
of motion; nor do you ever see in his works
a muscle in repose, than which a greater fault
Design knows not. He perfectly knew what
place each muscle ought to occupy, but never
gave its form. Nor did he understand the
nature of tendons, as he made them equally
fleshy from end to end, and his bones too
round. Raffaello partook of all these defects,
without ever reaching the profundity of his
muscular theory. Raffaello's strength lay in
characterizing aged and nervous frames; he
was too hard for delicacy, and in figures of
grandeur an exaggerated copy of M. Agnolo."
So far Mengs.</p>

<p>M. Agnolo appears to have had no infancy;
if he had, we are not acquainted with it. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
earliest works are equal in principle and compass
of execution to the vigorous proofs of his
virility. Like an oriental sun, he burst upon
us at once, without a dawn. Raffaello Sanzio
we see in his cradle, we hear him stammer,
but <i>propriety</i> rocked the cradle, and <i>character</i>
formed his lips. Even in the trammels of
Pietro Perugino, dry and servile in his style
of design, he traced what was essential, and
separated it from what was accidental in his
model. The works of Lionardo da Vinci and
the Cartoon of Pisa are said to have invigorated
his eye, but it was the Antique that
completed the system which he had begun to
establish on Nature; from them he learned
discrimination and choice of forms. He found
that in the construction of the body the articulations
of the bones were the true cause of ease
and grace in the action of the limbs, and that
the knowledge of this was the reason of the
superiority of antique design. He found that
certain features were fittest for certain expressions
and peculiar to certain characters; that
such a head, such hands, such feet, are the
stamen or the growth of such a body, and
on physiognomy established homogeneousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Of all artists he was the greatest, the most precise,
the most acute observer. When he designed,
he first attended to the primary intention
and motive of his figure, next to its general
measure, then to the bones and their articulations;
from them to the principal muscles,
or the muscles eminently wanted, and their
attendant nerves, and at last to the more or
less essential minuti&aelig;. But the characteristic
part of the subject is infallibly the characteristic
part of his design, if it be formed even by a
few rapid or a single stroke of his pen or pencil.
The strokes themselves are characteristic,
they follow or indicate the texture or fibre of
the part; flesh in their rounding, nerves in
straight, bones in angular touches.</p>

<p>Such was the felicity and such the propriety
of Raffaello when employed in the dramatic
evolutions of character,&mdash;both suffered when
he attempted to abstract the forms of sublimity
or beauty. The painter of humanity not
often wielded with success superhuman weapons.
His Gods never rose above prophetic
or patriarchial forms: if the finger of M. Agnolo
impressed the divine countenance oftener
with sternness than awe, the Gods of Raffaello<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
are sometimes too affable and mild, like him
who speaks to Jacob in the ceiling of the Vatican;
sometimes too violent, like him who separates
light from darkness in the Loggia: but
though made chiefly to walk with dignity on
earth, he soared above it in the mild effulgence
and majestic rapture of Christ on Tabor, not
indeed as we see his face now from the repairs
of the manufacturers in the Louvre,
and still more in the frown of the angelic
countenance that withers all the strength of
the warrior Heliodorus. Of ideal female
beauty, though he himself, in his letter to
Count Castiglione, tells us that from its scarcity
in life he made attempts to reach it by
an idea formed in his own mind, he certainly
wanted that standard which guided him in
character. His Goddesses and mythologic females
are no more than aggravations of the
generic forms of M. Agnolo. Roundness,
mildness, sanctimony, and insipidity, compose
the features and air of his Madonnas: transcripts
of the nursery, or some favourite face.
The Madonna del Impanato, the Madonna
Bella, the Madonna della Sedia, and even the
longer proportions and greater delicacy and
dignity of the Madonna formerly in the collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of Versailles, share more or less of
this insipidity: it chiefly arises from the high,
smooth, roundish forehead, the shaven vacuity
between the arched semicircular eye-brows,
their elevation above the eyes, and the ungraceful
division, growth and scantiness of
hair. This indeed might be the result of his
desire not to stain the virgin character of
sanctity with the most distant hint of coquetry
or meretricious charms; for in his
Magdalens, he throws it with luxuriant profusion,
and surrounds the breast and shoulders
with undulating waves and plaits of gold.
The character of Mary Magdalen met his,&mdash;it
was the character of a passion.</p>

<p>It is evident from every picture or design
at every period of his art in which she had
a part, that he supposed her enamoured when
she follows the body of the Saviour to the
tomb, or throws herself dishevelled over his
feet, or addresses him when he bears his cross.
The cast of her features, her forms, her action,
are the character of love in agony. When character
inspired Raffaello, his women became
definitions of grace and pathos at once.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is the exquisite line and turn of the
averted half-kneeling female with the two children
among the spectators of Heliodorus. Her
attitude, the turn of her neck, supplies all face,
and intimates more than he ever expressed by
features; and that she would not have gained
by showing them, may be guessed from her
companion on the foreground, who, though
highly elegant and equally pathetic in her action,
has not features worthy of either. The
fact is, form and style were by Raffaello employed
chiefly, if not always, as vehicles of character
and pathos; the Drama is his element,
and to that he has adapted them in a mode and
with a propriety which leave all attempts at
emendation hopeless: if his lines have been
excelled or rivalled in energy, correctness,
elegance,&mdash;considered as instruments of the
passions, they have never been equalled, and
as parts of invention, composition and expression
relative to his story, have never been
approached.</p>

<p>The result of these observations on M. Agnolo
and Raffaello is this, that M. Agnolo drew in
generic forms the human race; that Raffaello<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
drew the forms and characters of society diversified
by artificial wants.</p>

<p>We find therefore M. Agnolo more sublime,
and we sympathise more with Raffaello, because
he resembles us more. When Reynolds
said that M. Agnolo had more <i>imagination</i>, and
Raffaello more <i>fancy</i>, he meant to say, that the
one had more sublimity, more elementary fire;
the other was richer in social imagery, in genial
conceits, and artificial variety. Simplicity is
the stamen of M. Agnolo; varied propriety,
with character, that of Raffaello.</p>

<p>Of the great restorers of Art, the two we
have considered, made Design and Style the
basis of their plan, content with negative and
unambitious colour; the two next inverted the
principle, and employed Design and Style as
vehicles of <i>colour</i> or of <i>harmony</i>.</p>

<p>The style of Tiziano's design has two periods:
he began with copying what was before
him without choice, and for some time continued
in the meagre, anxious, and accidental
manner of Giovanni Bellino; but discovering
in the works of Giorgione that breadth of form
produced breadth of colour, he endeavoured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and succeeded, to see Nature by comparison,
and in a more ample light. That he possessed
the theory of the human body, needs not to be
proved from the doubtful designs which he is
said to have made for the anatomical work of
Vesalio; that he had familiarized himself with
the style of M. Agnolo, and burned with ambition
to emulate it, is less evident from adopting
some of his attitudes in the pictures of Pietro
Martyre and the Battle of Ghiaradadda, than
from the elemental conceptions, the colossal
style, and daring foreshortenings which astonish
in the Cain and Abel, the Abraham and
Isaac, the Goliath and David, on the ceiling of
the fabric of St. Spirito at Venice. Here, and
here alone, is the result of that union of tone
and style which, in Tintoretto's opinion, was
required to make a perfect painter,&mdash;for in
general the male forms of Tiziano are those of
sanguine health, often too fleshy for character,
less elastic than muscular, or vigorous without
grandeur. His females are the fair dimpled
Venetian race, soft without delicacy, too full for
elegance, for action too plump; his infants are
poised between both, and preferable to either.
In portrait he has united character and resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with dignity, and still remains unrivalled.</p>

<p>A certain national character marks the brightest
&aelig;ra of the Venetian school: however deviating
from each other, Tiziano, Tintoretto,
Bassan, and Paolo, acknowledged but one element
of imitation, Nature herself. This principle
each bequeathed to his followers; and no
attempt to adulterate its simplicity, by uniting
different methods, distinguished their immediate
successors. Hence they preserved features
of originality longer than the surrounding
schools, whom the vain wish to connect
incompatible excellence soon degraded to mediocrity,
and from that plunged to insignificance.</p>

<p>The soft transitions from the convex to the
concave line, which connect grandeur with
lightness, form the style of Correggio; but
using their coalition without balance, merely to
obtain a breadth of demi-tint and uninterrupted
tones of harmony, he became, from excess of
roundness, oftener heavy than light, and frequently
incorrect.</p>

<p>It is not easy, from the unaccountable obscurity
in which his life is involved, to ascertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
whether he saw the Antique in sufficient
degrees of quantity or beauty; but he certainly
must have been familiar with modelling,
and the helps of sculpture, to plan with such
boldness, and conquer with such ease, the unparalleled
difficulties of his foreshortenings.
His grace is oftener beholden to convenience
of place than elegance of line. The most appropriate,
the most elegant attitudes were
adopted, rejected, perhaps sacrificed to the
most awkward ones, in compliance with his
imperious principle: parts vanished, were absorbed,
or emerged in obedience to it.</p>

<p>The Dana&euml;, of which we have seen duplicates,
the head excepted, he seems to have
painted from an antique female torso. But
ideal beauty of face, if ever he conceived, he
never has expressed; his beauty is equally remote
from the idea of the Venus, the Niobe,
and the best forms of Nature. The Magdalen,
in the picture of St. Girolamo of Parma, is beholden
for the charms of her face to chiaroscuro,
and that incomparable hue and suavity of
bloom which scarcely permit us to discover the
defects of forms not much above the vulgar.
But that he sometimes reached the sublime, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
hiding the limits of his figures in the bland
medium which inwraps them, his Jupiter and
Io prove.</p>

<p>Such were the principles on which the Tuscan,
the Roman, the Venetian, and the Lombard
schools established their systems of style,
or rather the <i>manner</i> which, in various directions
and modes of application, perverted style.
M. Agnolo lived to see the electric shock which
his design had given to Art, propagated by the
Tuscan and Venetian schools as the ostentatious
vehicle of puny conceits and emblematic quibbles,
or the palliative of empty pomp and degraded
luxuriance of colour.</p>

<p>Of his imitators, the two most eminent are
Pellegrino Tibaldi, called "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">M. Agnolo riformato</span>"
by the Bolognese Eclectics, and Francesco
Mazzuoli, called Parmegiano.</p>

<p>Pellegrino Tibaldi penetrated the technic
without the moral principle of his master's
style; he had often grandeur of line without
sublimity of conception; hence the <i>manner</i> of
M. Agnolo is frequently the <i>style</i> of Pellegrino
Tibaldi. Conglobation and eccentricity, an aggregate
of convexities suddenly broken by rectangular,
or cut by perpendicular lines, compose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
his system. His fame principally rests on the
Frescoes of the Academic Institute at Bologna,
and the Ceiling of the Merchants' Hall at Ancona.
It is probably on the strength of those,
that the Carracci, his countrymen, are said to
have called him their "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">M. Agnolo riformato</span>,"&mdash;M.
Agnolo corrected. I will not do that injustice
to the Carracci to suppose, that for one
moment they could allude by this verdict to
the Ceiling and the Prophets and Sibyls of the
Capella Sistina; they glanced perhaps at the
technic exuberance of the Last Judgement, and
the senile caprices of the Capella Paolina.
These, they meant to inform us, had been
pruned, regulated, and reformed by Pellegrino
Tibaldi. Do his works in the Institute warrant
this verdict? So far from it, that it exhibits
little more than the dotage of M. Agnolo.
The single figures, groups, and compositions
of the Institute, present a singular mixture of
extraordinary vigour and puerile imbecility of
conception, of character and caricature, of style
and manner.</p>

<p>The figure of Polypheme groping at the
mouth of his cave for Ulysses, and the composition
of &AElig;olus granting to Ulysses favourable
winds, are striking instances of both. Than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the Cyclops, M. Agnolo himself never conceived
a form of savage energy, provoked by
sufferings and revenge, with attitude and limbs
more in unison; whilst the God of Winds is
degraded to the scanty and ludicrous semblance
of Thersites, and Ulysses with his
companions travestied by the semi-barbarous
look and costume of the age of Constantine
or Attila.</p>

<p>From Pellegrino Tibaldi, the Germans,
Dutch, and Flemings, Hemskerk, Goltzius,
and Spranger, borrowed the compendium of
the great Tuscan's peculiarities, dropsied the
forms of vigour, or dressed the gewgaws of
children in colossal shapes.</p>

<p>Parmegiano poised his line between the grace
of Correggio and the energy of M. Agnolo,
and from contrast produced Elegance; but instead
of making propriety her measure, degraded
her to affectation. That disengaged
play of delicate forms, the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">sueltezza</span>" of the
Italians, is the prerogative of Parmegiano,
though nearly always obtained at the expense
of proportion. He conceived the variety, but
not the simplicity of beauty, and drove contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to extravagance. The figure of St. John,
in the altar-piece of St. Salvador at Citt&agrave; di
Castello, now at the Marquis of Abercorn's,
and known from the print of Giulio Bonasone,
which less imitates than exaggerates its
original in the Cartoon of Pisa, is one proof
among many: his action is the accident of
his attitude; he is conscious of his grandeur,
and loses the fervour of the apostle in
the orator.</p>

<p>So his celebrated Moses, if I see right, has in
his forms less of grandeur than agility, in his
action more passion than majesty, and loses
the legislator in the savage. This figure, together
with Raphael's figure of God in the
Vision of Ezekiel, is said to have furnished
Gray with some of the master-traits of his
Bard,&mdash;figures than which Painting cannot
produce two more dissimilar: calm, placid
contemplation, and the decided burst of passion
in coalition.</p>

<p>Whilst M. Agnolo was doomed to live and
brood over the perversion of <i>his</i> style, death
prevented Raffaello from witnessing the gradual
decay of his.</p>

<p>Such was the state of style, when, toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the decline of the sixteenth century, Lodovico
Carracci, with his cousins Agostino and Annibale,
founded at Bologna, on the hints caught
from Pellegrino Tibaldi, that Eclectic School
which, by selecting the beauties, correcting the
faults, supplying the defects, and avoiding the
extremes of the different styles, attempted to
form a perfect system. The specious ingredients
of this technic panacea have been preserved
in a complimentary sonnet of Agostino
Carracci, and are compounded of the design
and symmetry of Raffaello, the terrible manner
of M. Agnolo, the sovereign purity of Correggio's
style, Tiziano's truth and nature, Tintoretto's
and Paolo's vivacity and chiaroscuro,
Lombardy's tone of colour, the learned invention
of Primaticcio, the decorum and solidity
of Pellegrino Tibaldi, and a little of Parmegiano's
grace, all amalgamated by Niccolo dell'
Abbate.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt a parody of this prescription
by transferring it to Poetry, and prescribing
to the candidate for dramatic fame
the imitation of Shakspeare, Otway, Jonson,
Milton, Dryden, Congreve, Racine, Addison,
as amalgamated by Nicholas Rowe. Let me
only ask whether such a mixture of demands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
ever entered with equal evidence the mind of
any one artist, ancient or modern; whether,
if it be granted possible that they did, they
were ever balanced with equal impartiality;
and grant this, whether they ever were or
could be executed with equal felicity? A
character of equal universal power is not a
human character; and the nearest approach to
perfection can only be in carrying to excellence
one great quality with the least alloy of
collateral defects: to attempt more will probably
end in the extinction of character, and
that, in mediocrity&mdash;the cypher of Art.</p>

<p>And were the Carracci such? Separate the
precept from the practice, the artist from the
teacher, and the Carracci are in possession of
my submissive homage. Lodovico is the inventor
of that solemn hue, that sober twilight,
which you have heard so often recommended
as the proper tone of historic colour. Agostino,
with learning, taste, and form, combined
Corregiesque tints. Annibale, inferior to both
in sensibility and taste, in the wide range of
talent, undaunted execution and academic
prowess, left either far behind. But if he preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the breadth of the style we speak of,
he added nothing to its dignity; his pupils
were inferior to <i>him</i>, and to his pupils, their
successors. <i>Style</i> continued to linger, with
fatal symptoms of decay, in Italy; and if it
survives, has not yet found a place to re-establish
its powers on this side of the Alps.</p>

<p class="centerb">TWELFTH LECTURE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Such</span> is the influence of the plastic Arts on
society, on manners, sentiments, the commodities
and the ornaments of life, that we think
ourselves generally entitled to form our estimate
of times and nations by its standard. As
our homage attends those whose patronage
reared them to a state of efflorescence or maturity,
so we pass with neglect, or pursue with
contempt, the age or race which want of culture
or of opportunity averted from developing
symptoms of a similar attachment.</p>

<p>A genuine perception of Beauty is the highest
degree of education, the ultimate polish of
man; the master-key of the mind, it makes us
better than we were before. Elevated or
charmed by the contemplation of superior
works of Art, our mind passes from the images
themselves to their authors, and from them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the race which reared the powers that furnish
us with models of imitation or multiply our
pleasures.</p>

<p>This inward sense is supported by exterior
motives in contact with a far greater part of
society, whom wants and commerce connect
with the Arts; for nations pay or receive
tribute in proportion as their technic sense
exerts itself or slumbers. Whatever is commodious,
amene, or useful, depends in a great
measure on the Arts: dress, furniture, and
habitation owe to their breath what they can
boast of grace, propriety, or shape: they teach
Elegance to finish what Necessity invented,
and make us enamoured of our wants.</p>

<p>This benign influence infallibly spreads or
diminishes in proportion as its original source,
a sense of genuine Beauty, flows from an ample
or a scanty vein, in a clear or turbid stream.
As Taste is adulterated or sinks, Ornament
takes a meagre, clumsy, barbarous, ludicrous, or
meretricious form; Affectation dictates; Simplicity
and elegance are loaded; interest vanishes:
in a short time Necessity alone remains,
and Novelty with Error go hand in hand.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>These obvious observations on the importance
of the Arts, lead to the question so often discussed,
and at no time more important than
ours&mdash;on the causes that raised them at various
times, and among different nations&mdash;on the
means of assisting their progress, and how to
check their decay. Of much that has been
said on it, much must be repeated, and something
added.</p>

<p>The Greeks commonly lead the van of the
arguments produced to answer this question.
Their religious and civil establishments; their
manners, games, contests of valour and of
talents; the Cyclus of their Mythology, peopled
with celestial and heroic forms; the honours,
the celebrity of artists; the serene Grecian
sky and mildness of the climate, are the
causes supposed to have carried that nation
within the ken of perfection.</p>

<p>Without refusing to each of these various
advantages its share of effect, History informs
us that if Religion and Liberty prepared a
public, and spread a technic taste over all
Greece, Athens and Corinth must be considered
as the principal nurses of Art, without whose
fostering care the general causes mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
could not have had so decided an effect; for
nothing surely contributed so much to the gradual
evolution of Art, as that perpetual opportunity
which they presented to the artist of
public exhibition; the decoration of temples,
halls, porticoes, a succession of employments
equally numerous, important, and dignified:
hence that emulation to gain the heights of
Art; the fervour of public encouragement,
the zeal and gratitude of the artists were reciprocal:
Polygnotus prepared with Cimon
what Phidias with Pericles established, on public
taste, Essential, Characteristic, and Ideal
Styles.</p>

<p>Whether human nature admitted of no more,
or other causes prevented a farther evolution
of powers, nothing greater did arise; Polish,
Elegance, and Novelty supplied Invention:
here is the period of decay; the Art gradually
sunk to mediocrity, and its final reward&mdash;Indifference.</p>

<p>The artist and the public are ever in the
strictest reciprocity: if the Arts flourished
nowhere as in Greece, no other nation ever interested
itself with motives so pure in their
establishment and progress, or allowed them so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
ample a compass. As long as their march was
marked with such dignity, whilst their union excited
admiration, commanded attachment, and
led the public, they grew, they rose; but when
individually to please, the artist attempted to
monopolize the interest due to Art, to abstract
by novelty and to flatter the multitude, ruin
followed. To prosper, the Art not only must
feel itself free, it ought to reign: if it be
domineered over, if it follow the dictate of
Fashion or a Patron's whims, then is its dissolution
at hand.</p>

<p>To attain the height of the Ancient was impossible
for Modern Art, circumscribed by narrower
limits, forced to form itself rapidly and
on borrowed principles; still it owes its origin
and support to nearly similar causes. During
the fourteenth, and still more in the course of
the fifteenth century, so much activity, so general
a predilection for Art spread themselves
over the greater part of Italy, that we are
astonished at the farrago of various imagery
produced at those periods. The artist and the
Art were indeed considered as little more than
craftsmen and a craft; but they were indemnified
for the want of honours, by the dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of their employment, by commissions to decorate
churches, convents, and public buildings.</p>

<p>Let no one to whom truth and its propagation
are dear, believe or maintain that Christianism
was inimical to the progress of Arts,
which probably nothing else could have revived.
Nothing less than Christian enthusiasm could
give that lasting and energetic impulse whose
magic result we admire in the works that illustrate
the period of Genius and their establishment.
Nor is the objection that England,
France, and Germany professed Christianity,
built churches and convents, and yet had no
Art, an objection of consequence; because it
might with equal propriety be asked, why it
did not appear sooner in Italy itself. The Art
forms a part of social education and the ultimate
polish of man, nor can it appear during
the rudeness of infant societies; and as, among
the Western nations, the Italians were the first
who extricated themselves from the bonds of
barbarism and formed asylums for industry,
Art and Science kept pace with the social progress,
and produced their first legitimate essays
among them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>How favourably religious enthusiasm operated
on Art, their sympathetic revolutions
still farther prove; they flourished, they languished,
they fell together. As zeal relented
and public grandeur gave way to private
splendour, the Arts became the hirelings of
Vanity and Wealth; servile they roamed from
place to place, ready to administer to the
whims and wants of the best bidder: in this
point of sight we can easily solve all the ph&aelig;nomena
which occur in the history of Art,&mdash;its
rise, its fall, eclipse, and re-appearance in
various places, with styles as different as various
tastes.</p>

<p>The efficient cause, therefore, why higher
Art at present is sunk to such a state of inactivity
and languor that it may be doubted
whether it will exist much longer, is not a
particular one, which private patronage, or the
will of an individual, however great, can remove;
but a general cause, founded on the
bent, the manners, habits, modes of a nation,&mdash;and
not of one nation alone, but of all who at
present pretend to culture. Our age, when
compared with former ages, has but little occasion
for great works, and that is the reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
why so few are produced:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;the ambition, activity,
and spirit of public life is shrunk to the
minute detail of domestic arrangements&mdash;every
thing that surrounds us tends to show us in
private, is become snug, less, narrow, pretty,
insignificant. We are not, perhaps, the less
happy on account of all this; but from such
selfish trifling to expect a system of Art built
on grandeur, without a total revolution, would
only be less presumptuous than insane.</p>

<p>What right have we to expect such a revolution
in our favour?</p>

<p>Let us advert for a moment to the enormous
difference of difficulty between forming and
amending the taste of a public&mdash;between legislation
and reform: either task is that of Genius;
both have adherents, disciples, champions; but
persecution, derision, checks will generally oppose
the efforts of the latter, whilst submission,
gratitude, encouragement, attend the
smooth march of the former. No madness is so
incurable as wilful perverseness; and when men
can once, with Medea, declare that they know
what is best, and approve of it, but must, or
choose to follow the worst, perhaps a revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
worse to be dreaded than the disease itself,
must precede the possibility of a cure. Though,
as it has been observed, the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries granted to the artists little
more than the attention due to ingenious
craftsmen; they were, from the object of their
occupations and the taste of their employers,
the legitimate precursors of M. Agnolo and
Raffaello, who did no more than raise their
style to the sublimity and pathos of the subject.
These trod with loftier gait and bolder
strides a path, on which the former had sometimes
stumbled, often crept, but always advanced:
the public and the artist went hand
in hand&mdash;but on what spot of Europe can the
young artist of our day be placed to meet with
circumstances equally favourable? Arm him,
if you please, with the epic and dramatic
powers of M. Agnolo and Raffaello, where
are the religious and civic establishments,
where the temples and halls open to receive,
where the public prepared to call them forth,
to stimulate, to reward them?</p>

<p>Idle complaints! I hear a thousand voices
reply! You accuse the public of apathy for
the Arts, while public and private exhibitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
tread on each other's heels, panorama opens on
panorama, and the splendour of galleries dazzles
the wearied eye, and the ear is stunned
with the incessant stroke of the sculptor's hammer,
and our temples narrowed by crowds of
monuments shouldering each other to perpetuate
the memory of Statesmen who deluded, or
of Heroes who bled at a Nation's call! Look
round all Europe&mdash;revolve the page of history
from Osymandias to Pericles, from Pericles
to Constantine&mdash;and say what age, what
race stretched forth a stronger arm to raise the
drooping genius of Art? Is it the public's
fault if encouragement is turned into a job, and
dispatch and quantity have supplanted excellence
and quality, as objects of the artist's emulation?&mdash;And
do you think that accidental
and temporary encouragement can invalidate
charges founded on permanent causes? What
blew up the Art, will in its own surcease terminate
its success. Art is not ephemeral; Religion
and Liberty had for ages prepared what
Religion and Liberty were to establish among
the ancients: the germ of the Olympian Jupiter,
and the Minerva of Phidias, lay in the
Gods of A&euml;gina, and that of Theseus, Hercules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and Alcibiades in the blocks of Harmodios and
Aristogiton.</p>

<p>If the revolution of a neighbouring nation
emancipated the people from the yoke of superstition,
it has perhaps precipitated them to irreligion.
He who has no visible object of worship
is indifferent about modes, and rites, and
places; and unless some great civil provisional
establishment replaces the means furnished by
the former system, the Arts of France, should
they disdain to become the minions and handmaids
of fashion, may soon find that the only
public occupation left for them will be a representation
of themselves, deploring their new-acquired
advantages. By a great establishment,
I mean one that will employ the living
artists, raise among them a spirit of emulation
dignified by the objects of their occupation,
and inspire the public with that spirit; not an
ostentatious display of ancient and modern
treasures of genius, accumulated by the hand
of conquest or of rapine. To plunder the earth
was a Roman principle, and it is not perhaps
matter of lamentation that Modern Rome, by
a retaliation of her own principle, is made to
pay the debt contracted with mankind. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
let none fondly believe that the importation of
Greek and Italian works of Art is an importation
of Greek and Italian genius, taste, establishments
and means of encouragement; without
transplanting and disseminating these, the
gorgeous accumulation of technic monuments
is no more than a dead capital, and, instead of
a benefit, a check on living Art.</p>

<p>With regard to ourselves, the barbarous,
though then perhaps useful rage of image-breakers
in the seventeenth century, seems
much too gratuitously propagated as a principle
in an age much more likely to suffer from
irreligion than superstition. A public body inflamed
by superstition, suffers, but it suffers
from the ebullitions of radical heat, and may
return to a state of health and life; whilst a
public body plunged into irreligion, is in a
state of palsied apathy, the cadaverous symptom
of approaching dissolution. Perhaps neither
of these two extremes may be precisely
our own state; we probably float between both.
But surely in an age of inquiry and individual
liberty of <i>thought</i>, when there are almost as
many sects as heads, there was little danger
that the admission of Art to places of devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
could ever be attended by the errors of idolatry;
nor have the motives which resisted the
offer of ornamenting our churches perhaps any
eminent degree of ecclesiastic or political sagacity
to recommend them. Who would not
rejoice if the charm of our Art, displaying the
actions and example of the sacred Founder of
our religion and of his disciples in temples and
conventicles, contributed to enlighten the zeal,
stimulate the feelings, sweeten the acrimony, or
dignify the enthusiasm of their respective audiences?
The source of the grand monumental
style of Greece was Religion with Liberty.
At that period the artist, as Pliny expresses
himself, was the property of the public, or in
other words, he considered himself as responsible
for the influence of his works on public
principle: with the decline of Religion and
Liberty his importance and the Art declined;
and though the Egyptian custom of embalming
the dead and suffering the living to linger
had not yet been adopted, from the organ of
the public he became the tool of private patronage;
and private patronage, however commendable
or liberal, can no more supply the
want of general encouragement, than the conservatories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and hotbeds of the rich, the want of
a fertile soil or genial climate. Luxury in
times of taste keeps up execution in proportion
as it saps the dignity and moral principle of the
Art; gold is the motive of its exertions, and
nothing that ennobles man was ever produced
by gold. When Nero transported the Pontic
Apollo to the golden house, and furnished the
colossal shoulders of the god with his own
head, Sculpture lent her hand to legitimate the
sacrilege: why should Painting be supposed to
have been more squeamish when applied to
decorate the apartments of his pleasures
and the cabinet of Popp&aelig;a with Milesian pollutions,
or the attitudes of Elephantis?</p>

<p>The effect of honours and rewards has been
insisted on as a necessary incentive to artists:
they ought indeed to be, they sometimes are,
the result of superior powers; but accidental
or partial honours cannot create Genius, nor
private profusion supply public neglect. No
genuine work of Art ever was or ever can be
produced, but for its own sake; if the artist do
not conceive to please himself, he never will
finish to please the world. Can we persuade
ourselves that all the treasures of the globe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
could suddenly produce an Iliad or Paradise
Lost, or the Jupiter of Phidias, or the Capella
Sistina? Circumstances may assist or
retard parts, but cannot make them: they are
the winds that now blow out a light, now animate
a spark to conflagration. Nature herself
has set her barriers between age and age, between
genius and genius, which no mortal
overleaps; all attempts to raise to perfection
at once, what can only be reared by a succession
of epochs, must prove abhortive and nugatory:
the very proposals of premiums, honours,
and rewards to excite talent or rouse
genius, prove of themselves that the age is
unfavourable to Art; for, had it the patronage
of the public, how could it want them?</p>

<p>We have now been in possession of an Academy
more than half a century; all the intrinsic
means of forming a style alternate at
our commands; professional instruction has
never ceased to direct the student; premiums
are distributed to rear talent and stimulate emulation,
and stipends are granted to relieve the
wants of genius and finish education. And
what is the result? If we apply to our Exhibition,
what does it present, in the aggregate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
but a gorgeous display of varied powers, condemned,
if not to the beasts, at least to the
dictates of fashion and vanity? What therefore
can be urged against the conclusion, that,
as far as the public is concerned, the Art is
sinking, and threatens to sink still deeper,
from the want of demand for great and significant
works? Florence, Bologna, Venice, each
singly taken, produced in the course of the sixteenth
century alone, more great historic pictures
than all Britain taken together, from its
earliest attempts at painting to its present efforts.
What are we to conclude from this?
that the soil from which Shakspeare and Milton
sprang, is unfit to rear the Genius of Poetic
Art? or find the cause of this seeming
impotence in that general change of habits,
customs, pursuits, and amusements, which for
near a century has stamped the national character
of Europe with apathy or discountenance
of the genuine principles of Art?</p>

<p>But if the severity of these observations, this
denudation of our present state moderates our
hopes, it ought to invigorate our efforts for the
ultimate preservation, and, if immediate restoration
be hopeless, the gradual recovery of Art.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
To raise the Arts to a conspicuous height may
not perhaps be in our power; we shall have
deserved well of posterity if we succeed in
stemming their farther downfall, if we fix
them on the solid base of principle. If it be
out of our power to furnish the student's activity
with adequate practice, we may contribute
to form his theory; and Criticism founded
on experiment, instructed by comparison, in
possession of the labours of every epoch of
Art, may spread the genuine elements of taste,
and check the present torrent of affectation and
insipidity.</p>

<p>This is the real use of our Institution, if
we may judge from analogy. Soon after the
middle of the sixteenth century, when the
gradual evanescence of the great luminaries in
Art began to alarm the public, an idea started
at Florence of uniting the most eminent artists
into a society, under the immediate patronage
of the Grand Duke, and the title of Academy:
it had something of a Conventual air,
has even now its own chapel, and celebrates an
annual festival with appropriate ceremonies;
less designed to promote than to prevent the
gradual debasement of Art. Similar associations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in other places were formed in imitation,
and at the time of the Carracci even the private
schools of painters adopted the same name.
All, whether public or private, supported by
patronage or individual contribution, were and
are symptoms of Art in distress, monuments
of public dereliction and decay of Taste. But
they are at the same time the asylum of the
student, the theatre of his exercises, the repositories
of the materials, the archives of the
documents of our art, whose principles their
officers are bound now to maintain, and for
the preservation of which they are responsible
to posterity, undebauched by the flattery, heedless
of the sneers, undismayed by the frown of
their own time.</p>

<p class="p2b">Permit me to part with one final observation.
Reynolds has told us, and from <i>him</i>
whose genius was crowned with the most brilliant
success during his life, from him it came
with unexampled magnanimity, "that those
who court the applause of their own time,
must reckon on the neglect of posterity." On
this I shall not insist as a general maxim; all
depends on the character of the time in which
an artist lives, and on the motive of his exertions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
M. Agnolo, Raffaello, Tiziano, and
Vasari, Giuseppe d'Arpino, and Luca Giordano,
enjoyed equal celebrity during their own
times. The three first enjoy it now, the three
last are forgotten or censured. What are we
to infer from this unequal verdict of posterity?
What, but what Cicero says, that time obliterates
the conceits of opinion or fashion, and
establishes the verdicts of Nature? The age
of Julio and Leone demanded genius for its
own sake, and found it&mdash;the age of Cosmo,
Ferdinand, and Urban, demanded talents and
dispatch to flatter their own vanity, and found
them too; but Cosmo, Ferdinand, and Urban,
are sunk in the same oblivion, or involved in
the same censure with their tools&mdash;Julio and
Leone continue to live with the permanent
powers which they had called forth.</p>

<h4>APHORISMS.</h4>

<p class="p2tbh">1. <span class="smcap">Life</span> is rapid, art is slow, occasion coy,
practice fallacious, and judgment partial.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">2. The price of excellence is labour, and
time that of immortality.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">3. Art, like love, excludes all competition,
and absorbs the man.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">4. Art is the attendant of nature, and genius
and talent the ministers of art.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">5. Genius either discovers new materials of
nature, or combines the known with novelty.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">6. Talent arranges, cultivates, polishes, the
discoveries of genius.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">7. Intuition is the attendant of genius; gradual
improvement that of talent.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">8. Arrangement presupposes materials: fruits
follow the bud and foliage, and judgment the
luxuriance of fancy.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">9. The fiery sets his subject in a blaze, and
mounts its vapours; the melancholy cleaves
the rock, or gropes through thorns for his;
the sanguine deluges all, and seizes none; the
phlegmatic sucks one, and drops off with repletion.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">10. Some enter the gates of art with golden
keys, and take their seats with dignity among
the demi-gods of fame; some burst the doors
and leap into a niche with savage power; thousands
consume their time in chinking useless
keys, and aiming feeble pushes against the
inexorable doors.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">11. Heaven and earth, advantages and obstacles,
conspire to educate genius.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">12. Organization is the mother of talent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
practice its nurse; the senses its dominion;
but hearts alone can penetrate hearts.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">13. It is the lot of genius to be opposed, and
to be invigorated by opposition: all extremes
touch each other; frigid praise and censure
wait upon attainable or common powers; but
the successful adventurer in the realms of discovery
leaps on an unknown or long-lost shore,
ennobles it with his name, and grasps immortality.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">14. Genius without bias, is a stream without
direction: it inundates all, and ends in
stagnation.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">15. He who pretends to have sacrificed genius
to the pursuits of interest or fashion; and
he who wants to persuade you he has indisputable
titles to a crown, but chooses to wave
them for the emoluments of a partnership in
trade, deserve equal belief.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">16. Taste is the legitimate offspring of nature,
educated by propriety: fashion is the
bastard of vanity, dressed by art.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">17. The immediate operation of taste is to
ascertain the kind; the next, to appreciate the
degrees of excellence.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Taste, founded on sense and elegance
of mind, is reared by culture, invigorated
by practice and comparison: scantiness stops
short of it; fashion adulterates it: it is shackled
by pedantry, and overwhelmed by luxuriance.</p>

<p class="ph">Taste sheds a ray over the homeliest or the
most uncouth subject. Fashion frequently
flattens the elegant, the gentle, and the great,
into one lumpy mass of disgust.</p>

<p class="p2bh">If "foul and fair" be all that your gross-spun
sense discerns, if you are blind to the intermediate
degrees of excellence, you may perhaps
be a great man&mdash;a senator&mdash;a conqueror;
but if you respect yourself, never presume to
utter a syllable on works of taste.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">18. If mind and organs conspire to qualify
you for a judge in works of taste, remember
that you are to be possessed of three things&mdash;the
subject of the work which you are to
examine; the character of the artist as such;
and, before all, of impartiality.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;All first impressions are involuntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and inevitable; but the knowledge of the subject
will guide you to judge first of the whole;
not to creep on from part to part, and nibble at
execution before you know what it means to
convey. The notion of a tree precedes that of
counting leaves or disentangling branches.</p>

<p class="ph">Every artist has, or ought to have, a character
or system of his own; if, instead of referring
that to the test of nature, you judge him by
your own packed notions, or arraign him at the
tribunal of schools which he does not recognize&mdash;you
degrade the dignity of art, and add another
fool to the herd of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dilettanti</span>.</p>

<p class="p2bh">But if, for reasons best known to yourself,
you come determined to condemn what yet
you have not seen, let me advise you to drop
your pursuits of art for one of far greater importance&mdash;the
inquiry into yourself; nor aim
at taste till you are sure of justice.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">19. Misconception of its own powers is the
injurious attendant of genius, and the most
severe remembrancer of its vanity.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Much of Leonardo da Vinci's life
evaporated in useless experiment and quaint
research; Michael Angelo perplexed the limbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of grandeur with the minute ramifications of
anatomy; Rafaelle forsook humanity to people
a mythologic desert with clumsy gods and
clumsier goddesses; Shakspeare, trusting time
and chance with Hamlet and Othello, revised a
frozen sonnet, or fondled his Adonis; whilst
Milton dropt the trumpet that had astonished
hell, left Paradise, and introduced a pedagogue
to Heaven. When genius is surprised by
such lethargic moments, we can forget that
Johnson wrote Irene, and Hogarth made a solemn
fool of Paul.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="p2bh">20. Reality teems with disappointment for
him whose sources of enjoyment spring in the
elysium of fancy.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">21. Where perfection cannot take place, a
very high degree of general excellence is impossible.
Negligence is the shade of energy;
where there is neither, expect mediocrity, the
common expletive of society; capacity without
elevation, industry without predilection, practice
without choice.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;"About this time," says Tacitus,
"died Popp&aelig;us Sabinus, who, from a middling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
origin, rose to imperial friendships, the consulate,
and the honours of the triumph: he was
selected for the space of four-and-twenty years
to govern the most important provinces,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> not
for any distinguished merit of his own, but because
he was equal to his task, and not above it."</p>

<p class="p2bh">Behold here the most comprehensive epitaph
of mediocrity, and the most unambiguous solution
of every riddle with which its brilliant
success may have perplexed your mind.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">22. Determine the principle on which you
commence your career of art: some woo the
art itself, some its appendages; some confine
their view to the present, some extend it to futurity:
the butterfly flutters round a meadow;
the eagle crosses seas.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">23. In ranging the phenomena of art, remember
carefully, though you place it on the
side of exceptions, that a decided bias is not
always a sign of latent power; nor indolence,
indifference, or even apathy, a sign of impotence.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p class="ph">24. Circumstances may assist or retard parts,
but cannot make them: they are the winds
that now blow out a light, now animate a spark
to conflagration.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Augustus and M&aelig;cenas are said to
have made Virgil: what was it, then, that
prevented Nerva, Trajan, Adrian, and the two
Antonines, from producing at least a Lucan?</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">25. Deserve, but expect not, to be praised by
your contemporaries, for any excellence which
they may be jealous of being allowed to possess
themselves; leave the dispensation of justice
to posterity.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">26. If wishes are the spawn of imbecility,
precipitation is the bantling of fool-hardiness:
legitimate will, investigates and acquires the
means. Mistake not an itching finger for authentic
will.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">27. Some of the most genuine effusions of
genius in art, some of the most estimable qualities
in society, may be beholden for our homage
to very disputable principles.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The admission of a master's humanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to his slave supposes the validity of an
execrable right; and the courage shown in a
duel cannot be applauded without submitting
to the dictates of feudal barbarity. Had the
poet's conception prepared us for the rashness
of Lear, the ambition of Macbeth's wife, and
the villany of Iago, by the usual gradations of
nature, he could not have rushed on our heart
with the irresistibility that now subdues it.
Had the line of Correggio floated in a less
expanse, he would have lost that spell of
light and shade which has enthralled all eyes;
and Rubens, had he not invigorated bodies to
hills of flesh, and tinged his pencil in the rainbow,
would not have been the painter of magnificence.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">28. Genius has no imitator. Some can be
poets and painters only at second-hand: deaf
and blind to the tones and motions of Nature
herself, they hear or see her only through some
reflected medium of art; they are emboldened
by prescription.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">29. Let him who has more genius than
talent give up as impossible what he finds difficult.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Talent may mimic genius with success,
and frequently impose on all but the first
judges; but genius is awkward in the attempt
to use the tools of talent.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Hyperides, Lysias, Isocrates, might
imitate much of Demosthenes; but he would
have become ridiculous by stooping to collect
their beauties.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The spear of Roland might
be couched to gain a lady's favour; but its sole
ornament was the heart, torn from the breast-plate

<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">30. Mediocrity is formed, and talent submits,
to receive prescription; that, the liveried attendant,
this, the docile client of a patron's
views or whims: but genius, free and unbounded
as its <i>origin</i>, scorns to receive commands,
or in submission, neglects those it
received.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The gentle spirit of Rafaelle embellished
the conceits of Bembo and Divizio,
to scatter incense round the triple mitre of his
prince; and the Vatican became the flattering
annals of the court of Julius and Leo: whilst
Michael Angelo refused admittance to master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>

<p class="ph">31. Distinguish between genius and singularity
of character; an artist of mediocrity may
be an odd man: let the nature of works be
your guide.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">32. The most impotent, the most vulgar,
and the coldest artists generally arrogate to
themselves the most vigorous, the most dignified,
and the warmest subjects.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">33. He has powers, dignity, and fire, who
can inspire a trifle with importance.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">34. Know that nothing is trifling in the
hand of genius, and that importance itself becomes
a bauble in that of mediocrity:&mdash;the
shepherd's staff of Paris would have been an
engine of death in the grasp of Achilles; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
ash of Peleus could only have dropped from
the effeminate fingers of the curled archer.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">35. Art either imitates or copies, selects or
transcribes; consults the class, or follows the
individual.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">36. Imitative art, is either epic or sublime,
dramatic or impassioned, historic or circumscribed
by truth. The first astonishes, the
second moves, the third informs.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">37. Whatever hides its limits in its greatness&mdash;whatever
shows a feature of immensity,
let the elements of Nature or the qualities of
animated being make up its substance, is sublime.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">38. Whatever by reflected self-love inspires
us with hope, fear, pity, terror, love, or mirth&mdash;whatever
makes events, and time, and place,
the ministers of character and pathos, let fiction
or reality compose its tissue, is dramatic.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">39. That which tells us, not what might be,
but what is; circumscribes the grand and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
pathetic with truth of time, place, custom;
what gives "a local habitation and a name," is
historic.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;No human performance is either
purely epic, dramatic, or historic. Novelty
and feelings will make the historian sometimes
launch out into the marvellous; or will warm
his bosom and extort a tear.</p>

<p class="ph">The dramatist while gazing at some tremendous
feature, or the pomp of superior
agency, will drop the chain he holds, and be
absorbed in the sublime; whilst the epic or
lyric poet, forgetting his solitary grandeur,
will sometimes descend and mix with his
agents.</p>

<p class="p2bh">The tragic and the comic dramatists formed
themselves on Hector and Andromache, on
Irus and Ulysses. The spirit from the prison-house
breathes like the shade of Patroclus;
Octavia and the daughter of Soranus<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> melt
like Ophelia and Alcestis.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">40. Those who have assigned to the plastic
arts beauty, strictly so called, as the ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
end of imitation, have circumscribed the whole
by a part.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The charms of Helen and of Niobe
are instruments of sublimity: Meleager and
Cordelia fall victims to the passions; Agrippina
and Berenice give interest to truth.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">41. Beauty, whether individual or ideal,
consists in the concurrence of parts to one
end, or the union of the simple and the
various.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Whatever be your powers, assume
not to legislate on beauty: though always the
same herself, her empire is despotic, and subject
to the anarchies of despotism, enthroned to-day,
dethroned to-morrow: in treating subjects
of universal claim, most has been done by leaving
most to the reader's and spectator's taste or
fancy. "It is difficult," says Horace, "to pronounce
exactly to every man's eye and mind,
what every man thinks himself entitled to
estimate by a standard of his own."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
Apollo and Medicean Venus are not by all
received as the canons of male and female
beauty; and Homer's Helen is the finest woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
we have read of, merely because he has
left her to be made up of the Dulcineas of his
readers.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">42. Beauty alone, fades to insipidity; and
like possession cloys.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">43. Grace is beauty in motion, or rather
grace regulates the air, the attitudes and movements
of beauty.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">44. Nature makes no parade of her means&mdash;hence
all studied grace is unnatural.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The attitudes of Parmegiano are exhibitions
of studied grace. The grace of Guido
is become proverbial, but it is the grace of
the art.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">45. All actions and attitudes of children
are graceful, because they are the luxuriant
and immediate offspring of the moment&mdash;divested
of affectation, and free from all pretence.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The attitudes and motions of the
figures of Rafaelle are graceful because they
are poised by Nature.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
46. Proportion, or symmetry, is the basis of
beauty; propriety, of grace.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">47. Creation gives, invention finds existence.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">48. Invention in general is the combination
of the possible, the probable, or the known, in
a mode that strikes with novelty.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Invention has been said to mean no
more than the moment of any fact chosen by
the artist.</p>

<p class="p2bh">To say that the painter's invention is not to
find or to combine its own subject, is to confine
it to the poet's or historian's alms&mdash;is to annihilate
its essence; it says in other words, that
Macbeth or Ugolino would be no subjects for
the pencil, if they had not been prepared by history
and borrowed from Shakspeare and Dante.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">49. Ask not&mdash;Where is fancy bred? in
the heart? in the head? how begot? how
nourished?</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The critic who inquires whether in
the madness of Lear, grief for the loss of empire,
or the resentment of filial ingratitude preponderated&mdash;and
he who doubts whether it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
within the limits of art to embody beings of
fancy, agitate different questions, but of equal
futility.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">50. Genius may adopt, but never steals.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;An adopted idea or figure in the
works of genius will be a foil or a companion;
but an idea of genius borrowed by mediocrity
scorns the base alliance and crushes all its mean
associates&mdash;it is the Cyclop's thumb, by which
the pigmy measured his own littleness,&mdash;"or
hangs like a giant's robe upon a dwarfish thief."</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">51. Genius, inspired by invention, rends the
veil that separates existence from possibility;
peeps into the dark, and catches a shape, a feature,
or a colour, in the reflected ray.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">52. Talent, though panting, pursues genius
through the plains of invention, but stops short
at the brink that separates the real from the
possible. Virgil followed Homer in making
Mezentius speak to Rh&#339;bus, but shrank from
the reply of the prophetic courser.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p class="ph">53. Whenever the medium of any work,
whether lines, colour, grouping, diction, becomes
so predominant as to absorb the subject
in its splendour, the work is degraded to an
inferior order.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">54. The painter, who makes an historical
figure address the spectator from the canvass,
and the actor who addresses a soliloquy to you
from the stage, have equal claims to your contempt
or pity.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">55. Common-place figures are as inadmissible
in the grand style of painting as common-place
characters or sentiments in poetry.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Common-place figures were first introduced
by the gorgeous machinists of Venice,
and adopted by the Bolognese school of Eclectics;
the modern school of Rome from Carlo
Maratta to Battoni knew nothing else; and they
have been since indiscriminately disseminated
on this side of the Alps, by those whom mediocrity
obliged to hide themselves in crowds, or
a knack at grouping stimulated to aggregate a
rabble.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
56. The copious is seldom grand.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">57. Glitter is the refuge of the mean.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">58. All apparatus destroys terror, as all ornament
grandeur: the minute catalogue of the
cauldron's ingredients in Macbeth destroys the
terror attendant on mysterious darkness; and
the seraglio-trappings of Rubens annihilate his
heroes.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">59. All conceits, not founded upon probable
combinations of nature, are absurd. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">capricci</i>
of Salvator Rosa, and of his imitators,
are, to the fiends of Michael Angelo, what the
paroxysms of a fever are to the sallies of vigorous
fancy.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">60. Distinguish carefully between bold fancy
and a daring hand; between the powers of nature
and the acquisitions of practice: most of
Salvator's <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">banditti</span> are a medley made up of
starveling models and the shreds of his lumber-room
brushed into notice by a daring pencil.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
61. Distinguish between boldness and brutality
of hand, between the face of beauty and
<i>the bark of a tree</i>.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">62. All mediocrity pretends.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">63. Invention, strictly speaking, being confined
to <i>one</i> moment, he invents best who in
that moment combines the traces of the past,
the energy of the present, and a glimpse of the
future.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">64. Composition has been divided into natural
and ornamental: that is dictated by the
subject, this by effect or situation.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">65. Distinguish between composition and
grouping: though none can compose without
grouping, most group without composing.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The assertion that grouping may not
be composing, has been said to make a distinction
without a difference: as if there had not
been, still are, and always will be squadrons of
artists, whose skill in grouping can no more be
denied, than their claim to invention, and consequently
to composition, admitted, if invention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
means the true conception of a subject and
composition the best mode of representing it.
After the demise of Lionardo and Michael
Angelo, their successors, however discordant
else, uniformly agreed to lose the subject in the
medium. Raffaello had no followers. Tiziano
and something of Tintoretto excepted, what
instance can there be produced of composition
in the works of the Venetian school? Are the
splendid masquerades of Paolo to be dignified
with that name? If composition has a part in
the effusions of the great founder of the Lombard
school, it surely did not arrange the celestial
hubbub of his cupolas, content to inspire his
Io, the Zingaro, Christ in the Garden, perhaps
(I speak with diffidence) his Notte. So characteristically
separate from real composition
are the most splendid assemblages, the most
happy combinations of figures, if founded on
the mere power of grouping, that one of the
first, and certainly the most courteous critic in
Art of the age, in compliment to the Venetian
and Flemish Schools, has thought proper
to divide composition into legitimate and ornamental.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
66. Ask not, what is the shape of composition?
You may in vain climb the pyramid,
wind with the stream, or point the flame; for
composition, unbounded like Nature, and her
subjects, though resident in all, may be in
none of these.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">67. The nature of picturesque composition is
depth, or to come forward and recede.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Pausias, in painting a sacrifice, foreshortened
the victim, and threw its shade on
part of the surrounding crowd, to show its
height and length.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">68. Sculpture composes in single groups or
separate figures, but apposition is the element
of basso-relievo.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Poussin painted basso-relievo, Algardi
chiselled pictures.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">69. He who treats you with all the figures
of a subject save the principal, is as civil or
important as he who invites you to dine with
all a nobleman's family, the master only excepted:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
this sometimes may be no loss, but
surely you cannot be said to have dined with
the chief of the family.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">70. Examine whether an artist treats you
with a subject, or only with some of its limbs:
many see only the lines, some the masses,
others the colours, and not a few the mere back-ground
of their subject.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">71. Second thoughts are admissible in painting
and poetry only as dressers of the first conception;
no great idea was ever formed in
fragments.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">72. He alone can conceive and compose, who
sees the whole at once before him.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">73. He who conceives the given point of a
subject in many different ways, conceives it not
at all. Appeal to the artist's own feelings; you
will ever find him most reluctant to give up
that part of it which he conceived intuitively,
and readier to dismiss that which harassed him
by alteration.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
74. Metaphysical composition, if it be numerous,
will be oftener mistaken for dilapidation
of fragments than regular distribution
of materials.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The School of Athens as it is called,
by Raffaelle, communicates to few more than
an arbitrary assemblage of speculative groups:
yet if the subject be the dramatic representation
of philosophy, as it prepares for active
life, the parts of the building are not connected
with more regular gradation than those groups:
fitted by physical and intellectual harmony,
man ascends from himself to society, from society
to God.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">75. No excellence of execution can atone for
meanness of conception.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">76. Grandeur of conception will predominate
over the most vulgar materials&mdash;if in the subjects
of Jesus before Pilate, by Rembrandt, and
the Resuscitation of Lazarus by Lievens,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the
materials had all been equal to the conception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
they would have been works of superhuman
powers.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">77. Repetition of attitude and gesture invigorates
the expression of the grand: as a torrent
gives its own direction to every object it
sweeps along, so the impression of a sublime or
pathetic moment absorbs the contrasts of inferior
agents.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">78. Tameness lies on this side of expression,
grimace overleaps it; insipidity is the relative
of folly, eccentricity of madness.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">79. The fear of not being understood, or felt,
makes some invigorate expression to grimace.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">80. The temple of expression, like that of
religion, has a portico and a sanctuary; that is
trod by all, this only admits her votaries.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">81. Propriety, modesty and delicacy, guard
expression from the half-conceits of the weak,
the intemperance of the extravagant, and the
brutality of the vulgar.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
82. Sensibility is the mother of sympathy.
How can he paint Beauty who has not throbbed
at her charms? How shall he fill the eye
with the dew of humanity whose own never
shed a tear for others? How can he form a
mouth to threaten or command, who licks the
hereditary spittle of princes?</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">83. He fails with greater dignity, who expresses
the principal feature of his subject and
misses or neglects all the secondary, than he
who consumes his powers on what is subordinate
and comes exhausted to the chief.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Those who have asserted that Lionardo,
in finishing the Last Supper, was so exhausted
by his exertions to trace the characters
and emotions of the disciples, that, unable to
fix the physiognomy of Christ, he found himself
reduced to the necessity of leaving that
head unfinished,&mdash;either never saw it, or if they
did, were too low to reach the height, and too
shallow to fathom the depth of the conception.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">84. The coward, driven to despair, leaps
back into the face of danger; and the tame,
stimulated to exertions and aiming at expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
puffs spirit into flutter; or tears the garb
of passion and flourishes the rags.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">85. Affectation cannot excite sympathy.
How can you feel for him who cannot feel for
himself? How can he feel for himself, who
exhibits the artificial graces of studied attitude?</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">86. The loathsome is abominable, and no engine
of expression.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i> When Spenser dragged into light
the entrails of the serpent, slain by the Red-cross
Knight, he dreamt a butcher's dream and
not a poet's: and Fletcher,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> or his partner, when
rummaging the surgeon's box of cataplasms
and trusses to assuage hunger, solicited the
grunt of an applauding sty.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">87. Sympathy and disgust are the lines that
separate terror from horror: though we shudder
at, we scarcely pity what we abominate.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Rowe, when he congratulates the
ghost on bidding Hamlet spare his mother,
accuses <i>her</i> of a crime with which the poet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
never charged her: that Shakspeare might be
hurried on to horror let the "vile jelly" witness,
which Cornwall treads from Gloster's
bleeding sockets.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">88. Expression animates, convulses, or absorbs
form. The Apollo is animated; the
warrior of Agasias is agitated; the Laocoon is
convulsed; the Niobe is absorbed.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">89. The being seized by an enormous passion,
be it joy or grief, hope or despair, loses
the character of its own individual expression,
and is absorbed by the power of the feature
that attracts it: Niobe and her family are assimilated
by extreme anguish; Ugolino is petrified
by the fate that sweeps his sons; and
every metamorphosis from that of Clytie to the
transfusion of Gianni Fucci<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> tells a new allegory
of sympathetic power.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">90. Reject with indignant incredulity all self-congratulations
of conscious villainy, though
they be uttered by Richard or by Iago.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">91. The axe, the wheel, saw-dust, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
blood-stained sheet are not legitimate substitutes
of terror.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">92. All division diminishes, all mixtures impair
the simplicity and clearness of expression.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">93. The epoch which discovered expression,
or what the Greeks called "manners,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is marked
by Pliny as that which gave importance and
effect to art.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Homer invested his heroes with
ideal powers, but copied nature in delineating
their moral character. Achilles, the irresistible
in arms, clad in celestial armour, is a splendid
being, created by himself; Achilles the fool of
passions, is the real man delivered to him by
tradition.</p>

<p class="ph">That the plastic artist should have had an
aim beyond the poet is improbable, because the
poet, in general, furnished him with materials;
he composed his man of beauty and ideal limbs,
not to obscure, but to invigorate his character
and our attention.</p>

<p class="ph">The limbs, the form of Ajax hurling defiance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
from the sea-swept rock unto the murky
sky, were, no doubt, exquisite; but if the artist
mitigated his expression, the indignation due
to blasphemy from the spectator gave way to
sterner indignation at the injustice of his gods.</p>

<p class="ph">The expression of the ancients, from the
heights and depths of the sublime, descended
and emerged to search every nook of the human
breast; from the ambrosial locks of Zeus,
and the maternal phantom fluttering round
Ulysses,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to the half-slain mother, shuddering
lest the infant should suck the blood from her
palsied nipple, and the fond attention of Penelope
dwelling on the relation of her returned
son.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p class="ph">The expression of the ancients explored nature
even in the mute recesses, in the sullen
organs of the brute; from the Argus of Ulysses,
to the lamb, the symbol of expiatory resignation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
on an altar, and to the untameable feature
of the toad.</p>

<p class="ph">The expression of the ancients roamed all
the fields of licit and illicit pleasure; from the
petulance with which Ctesilochus exhibited the
pangs of a Jupiter delivered by celestial midwives,
to the libidinous sports of Parrhasius,
and from these to the indecent caricature<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
which furnished Crassus with a repartee.</p>

<p class="p2bh">The ancients extended expression even to
the colour of their materials in sculpture: to
express the remorse of Athamas, Aristonidas
the Theban mixed metals; and Alcon formed
a Hercules of iron, to express the perseverance
of the God.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">94. Invention, before it attends to composition,
group, or contrast, classes its subject and
ascertains what kind of impression it is to make
on the whole.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">95. Invention never suffers the action to
expire, nor the spectator's fancy to consume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
itself in preparation, or stagnate into repose:
it neither begins from the egg, nor coldly
gathers the remains; for action and interest
terminate together.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">96. The middle moment, the moment of
suspense, the crisis, is the moment of importance,
big with the past and pregnant with the
future: we rush from the flames with the Warrior
of Agasias, and look forward to his enemy;
or we hang in suspense over the wound of the
Expiring Soldier,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and poise with every drop
which yet remains of life.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">97. Distinguish between the hero and the
actor; between exertions of study and effects
of impulse.</p>
<hr class="r5" />

the palpitation of Hamlet cannot degenerate
into vulgar fright.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Of all the eclectics, Domenichino
alone composed for expression; but his expression
compared with Raffaello's is the expression
of Theocritus compared with that of Homer.
A detail of pretty images is rather calculated
to diminish than to enforce energy with
the whole: a lovely child taking refuge in the
bosom of a lovely mother is an idea of nature,
and pleasing in a lowly or domestic subject;
but amidst the terrors of martyrdom, it is a
shred tacked to a purple robe. In touching
the circle that surrounds the Ananias of Raffaelle,
you touch the electric chain; an irresistible
spark darts from the last as from the first, and
penetrates and subdues. At the Martyrdom
of St. Agnes,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> you saunter amidst the mob of
a lane, where the silly chat of neighbouring
gossips announces a topic as silly, till you find,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
with indignation, that instead of a broken pot,
or a petty theft, you are to witness a scene for
which Heaven opens, the angels descend, and
Jesus rises from his throne.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">99. Expression alone can invest beauty with
supreme and lasting command over the eye.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;On beauty, unsupported by vigour
and expression, Homer dwells less than on active
deformity; he tells us, in three lines, that
Nireus led three ships, his parentage, his form,
his effeminacy; but opens in Thersites a source
of comedy and entertainment.</p>

<p class="p2bh">Raffaelle not only subjected beauty to expression,
but, at the command of invention, degraded
it into a handmaid of deformity: thus
the flowers of infancy and youth, virility and
age, are scattered round the temple-gate, to impress
us more by comparison with the distorted
beings that crawl before and defy the powers
of every other hand but the one delegated by
Omnipotence.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p class="ph">100. Imitation seems to cease, where the
ideal part begins.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
101. The imitator rises above the copyist
by generalizing the individual to a class; the
idealist mounts above the imitator by uniting
classes.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">102. The imitator, by comparison and taste,
unites the scattered limbs of kindred excellence;
the idealist, by the "mind's eye," fixes,
personifies, embodies possibility: modes and degrees
of single powers are the province of the
former; the latter unites whatever implies no
contradiction in an assemblage of varied excellence.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;This is best explained by the Ilias.
Each individual of Homer forms a class, and is
circumscribed by one quality of heroic power;
Achilles alone unites their different energies.</p>

<p class="ph">The height, the strength, the giant-stride
and supercilious air of Ajax; the courage, the
impetuosity, the never-failing aim, the never-bloodless
stroke of Diomedes; the presence of
mind, the powerful agility of Ulysses; the velocity
of the lesser Ajax; Agamemnon's sense
of prerogative and domineering spirit,&mdash;assign
to each his separate class of heroism, yet lessen
not their shades of imperfection. Ajax appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the warrior rather than the leader; Ulysses is
too prudent to be more than brave; the hawk
more than the eagle predominates in the son of
Oileus; Agamemnon has the prerogative of
power, but not of heroism; Diomede alone
might appear to have been raised too high, had
he been endowed with an assuming spirit. So
far the poet found, ennobled, classified; but
all these he sums up, and creates an ideal form
from their assemblage, in Achilles:&mdash;he is the
grandson of Jupiter, the son of a goddess,
the favourite of Heaven&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>"What arms can
fit me but the shield of Ajax? The lance
maddens not in the grasp of Diomede to chase
the flames from the ships. Let him confer
with thee, Ulysses, and the rest." Such is
his language. Before the pursuer of Hector
vanishes the velocity of Ajax; from destroying
Agamemnon he is prevented by Minerva; he
gives his armour to the son of Men&#339;tius, and
disperses all but the gods; his spear none can
throw, and none tear from the ground when
thrown; a miracle alone can save those that
oppose him singly; when else he fights, 'tis not
to gain a battle, but to subvert Troy.

<p class="p2bh">What Achilles is to his confederates, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Apollo, the Torso, the statues<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of the Quirinal,
are to all other known figures of gods, of demi-gods
and heroes.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">103. Fancy not to compose an ideal form
by mixing up a mass of promiscuous beauties;
for, unless you consulted what was homogeneous
and what was possible in Nature, you
have hatched only a monster: this, we suppose,

the beauties of Agrigentum to compose a perfect

mythology, or to debase him to the dregs of
mankind.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Majesty is the feature of the Supreme
Being; no eternal Father of the moderns
approaches the majesty of Jupiter.</p>

<p class="ph">The gods of Michael Angelo are stern.
The gods of Raffaelle are affable and weak.
The gods of Guido have the air of ancient
courtiers.</p>

<p class="ph">In the race of Jupiter, majesty is tempered
by emanations of beauty and of grace, but
never softened into love.</p>

<p class="ph">The Christ of Michael Angelo is severe. The
Christ of Raffaelle is poised between the heraldry
of church tradition and the dignified mildness
of his own character. The Christ of
Guido is a well suspended corpse.</p>

<p class="ph">"The character corresponding with that of
Christ," says a critic and a painter,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> "is a mixture
of the characters of Jupiter and Apollo,
allowing only for the accidental expression of
the moment." What magic shall amalgamate
the superhuman airs of Rhea's and Latona's
sons with sufferings and resignation? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
critic, in his exultation, forgot the leading feature
of his master&mdash;humility.</p>

<p class="ph">Whatever be the ideal form of Christ, the
Saviour of mankind, extending his arm to relieve
the afflicted, the hopeless, the dying, is a
subject that comes home to the breast of every
one who calls himself after his name:&mdash;the
artist is in the sphere of adoration with the
Christian.</p>

<p class="ph">A great and beneficent character, eminently
exerting unknown healing powers over the family
of disease and pain, claims the participation
of every feeling man, though he be no
believer:&mdash;the artist is in the sphere of sentiment
with the Deist or Mahometan.</p>

<p class="ph">But a mean man marked with the features
of a mean sect, surrounded by a beggarly ill-shaped
rabble and stupid masks&mdash;is probably
a juggler that claims the attention of no one.</p>

<p class="ph">The Resurrection of Christ derives its interest
from its rapidity, the Ascension from its
slowness.</p>

<p class="ph">In the Resurrection, the hero, like a ball of
fire, shoots up resistless from the bursting tomb,
and scatters terror and astonishment,&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
apprehension could not dream of, what the eye
had never beheld, and tongue had never uttered,
blazes before us,&mdash;tumultuous agitation
rends the whole. Such is the spirit of the
Resurrection by Raffaelle.</p>

<p class="p2bh">The Ascension is the last of many similar
scenes: no longer with the rapidity of a conqueror,
but with the calm serenity of triumphant
power, the hero is borne up in splendour,
and gradually vanishes from those who,
by repeated visions, had been taught to expect
whatever was amazing. Silent and composed,
with eyes more absorbed in adoration than
wonder, they followed the glorious emanation,
till addressed by the white-robed messengers of
their departed King.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Francesco Barbieri broke like a torrent
over the academic rules of his masters.
As the desire of disseminating character over
every part of his composition made Raphael
less attentive to its general effect, so an ungovernable
itch of copying all that lay in his
way made this man sacrifice order, costume,
mind, to mere effects of colour: a map of
flesh, a pile of wood, a sleeve, a hilt, a feathered
hat, a table-cloth, or a gold-tissued robe, were
for Guercino what a quibble was for Shakspeare.
The countenance of his Dido has that
sublimity of woe which affects us in the &AElig;neis,
but she is pierced with a toledo and wrapped
in brocade; Anna is an Italian Duenna; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
scene, the Mole of Ancona or of Naples, the
spectators a brace of whiskered Spaniards, and
a deserting Amorino winds up the farce. In
his St. Petronilla the rags and brawny limbs of
two gigantic porters crush the effect which the
saint ought to have, and all the rest is frittered
into spots. Yet is that picture a tremendous
instance of mechanic powers and intrepidity
of hand. As a firm base supports, pervades,
unites the tones of harmony, so a certain stern
virility inspires, invigorates and gives a zest
to all Guercino's colour. The gayer tints of
Guido vanish before his as insipid,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Domenichino
appears laboured, and the Carracci dim.
Nor was Guercino a stranger to the genuine
expressions of untaught nature, and there is
more of pathos in the dog which he introduced
caressing the returned prodigal, than in all the
Farnese gallery; as the Argus of Ulysses, looking
up at his old master, then dropping his
head and dying, moves more than all the metamorphoses
of Ovid. If his male figures be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
brought to the test of style, it may be said,
that he never made a man; their virility is
tumour or knotty labour; to youth he gave
emaciated lankness, and to old age little besides
decrepitude and beards&mdash;meanness to all:
and though he was more cautious in female
forms, they owe the best part of their charms
to chiaroscuro.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">127. Execution has its classes.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Satan summoning the Princes of
Hell stretched over the fiery flood; or the
giant snake of the Norway seas hovering over
a storm-vexed vessel, by Gerard Douw, or Vanderverf&mdash;are

their design and Rembrandt massed their
light and shade.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">128. It has been said, but let us repeat it:
the proportion of will and power is not always

<p class="ph">130. He is a prince of artists and of men
who knows the moment when his work is

parts of a performance in an equal degree, no
artist ever finished his work. A great part of
conception or execution is always sacrificed to
some individual excellence which either he possesses
or thinks he possesses. The colourist
makes lines only the vehicle of colour; the designer
subordinates hue to his line; the man
of breadth or chiaroscuro overwhelms sometimes
both, and the subject itself to produce
effect.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Take the design of Rome, Venetian
motion and shade, Lombardy's tone of colour,
add the terrible manner of Angelo, Titian's
truth of nature, and the supreme purity of
Corregio's style; mix them up with the decorum
and solidity of Tibaldi, with the learned
invention of Primaticcio, and a few grains of
Parmegiano's grace: and what do you think will
be the result of this chaotic prescription, such
elemental strife? Excellence, perhaps, equal to
one or all of the names that compose these ingredients?
You are deceived, if you fancy
that a multitude of dissimilar threads can compose
a uniform texture&mdash;that dissemination of
spots will make masses, or a little of many
things produce a whole. If Nature stamped
you with a character, you will either annihilate
it by indiscriminate imitation of heterogeneous
excellence, or debase it to mediocrity and add
one to the ciphers of art. Yet such is the prescription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>

of lines sweetly convex, of very small obtuse
angles, and of flats, but the soft convexities
predominate the character of the figure, being
a compound of strength, dignity and delicacy.
The artist has expressed the first by convex
outlines, the second by their uniformity, and
the third by undulation of forms. The convex
line predominates in the Laocoon, and the
forms of the muscles are angular at their insertions
and ends to express agitation; for by
these means the nerves and tendons become
more visible, straight lines meeting with concave
and convex ones, form those angles which
produce violence of action. The sculptor of
the Farnesian Hercules invented a style totally
different; to obtain fleshiness, he composed the
figure of round and convex muscles, but made
their insertions flat to signify that they are
nervous and unincumbered with fat, the characteristic
of strength."</p>

Hercules in bronze are distinguished only by

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The line of Michael Angelo is uniformly
grand; character and beauty were admitted
only as far as they could be made subservient
to grandeur:&mdash;the child, the female,
meanness, deformity were indiscriminately
stamped with grandeur; a beggar rose from
his hand the patriarch of poverty; the hump
of his dwarf is impressed with dignity; his
women are moulds of generation; his infants
teem with the man, his men are a race of
giants.</p>

<p class="ph">The design of Raphael is either historic or
poetic. The forms of his historic style are characteristic,
those of his poetic style he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
calls ideal:<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the former are regulated by nature,
but these are only exaggerations of another
style.</p>

<p class="ph">The forms of Julio Pipi are poised between
character and caricature, but verge to this;
even his dresses and ornaments are caricatures;
but no poet or painter ever rocked the cradle
of infant mythology with simpler or more
primitive grace; none ever imparted to allegory
a more insinuating power, or swayed the
strife of elemental war with a bolder hand.
What ever equalled the exuberance of invention
scattered over the T of Mantoua?</p>

<p class="ph">The line of Polydoro, is that of the antique
basso-relievo, seen from beneath (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">da sotto in su</span>).</p>

<p class="ph">The forms of Titian are those of sanguine
health; robust, not grand; soft without delicacy.</p>

<p class="ph">Tintoretto attempted to fill the line of
Michael Angelo with colour, without tracing
its principle.</p>

<p class="ph">As Michael Angelo was impressed with an
idea of grandeur, so Correggio was charmed
with a notion of harmony: his line was correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
when harmony permitted; it strayed as harmony
commanded.</p>

<p class="ph">Elegance (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">sueltezza</span>) was the principle of
Parmegiano's line, but he forgot proportion.</p>

<p class="ph">Annibale Carracci, one of the founders of the
Eclectic school, attempted to combine in his
line the appearance of Nature with style, and
became the standard of academic drawing.</p>

<p class="ph">The medium, not the thing, was the object
of the <i>Tuscan</i> and <i>Venetian</i> schools; the school
of Urbino<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> aimed at subjecting the medium to
the character of things; the <i>Lombards</i> strove to
unite the separate attainments of the three with
the unattainable spell of Correggio; the <i>Germans</i>,
with their Flemish and Dutch branches,
now humbly followed, now boldly attempted
to improve their Italian masters; the French
passed the Alps to study at Rome and Venice
what they were to forget at Paris.</p>

<p class="ph">Domenichino aimed at the characteristic line
of Raffaelle, the compactness of Annibale, and
the beauty of the antique; and mixing something
of each fell short of all.</p>

<p class="ph">Rosso carried anatomy, and the Bolognese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Abbate the poetry of their art to the court of
Francis. To the haggard melancholy of the
Tuscan and the laboured richness of the Lombard,
the French added their own cold gaiety,
and the French school arose.</p>

<p class="ph">The forms of Guido's female heads are abstracts
of the antique. The forms of his male
bodies are transcripts of models, such as are
found in a genial climate, though sometimes
distorted by fatigue or emaciated by want.</p>

<p class="ph">Pietro Testa copied the Torsos of antiquity,
and supplied them with extremities drawn from
the dregs of Nature.</p>

<p class="ph">The forms<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> of Caravaggio are either substantial
flesh or the starveling produce of beggary
rendered important by ideal light and shade.</p>

<p class="ph">The limbs of Joseph Ribera are excrescences
of disease on hectic bodies.</p>

<p class="ph">Andrea Mantegna was in Italy what Albert
Durer was at Nuremberg; Nature seems not
to have existed in any shape of health in his
time: though a servile copyist of the antique,
he never once adverted from the monuments he
copied to the originals that inspired them.</p>

<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
The forms of Albert Durer are blasphemies
on Nature, the thwarted growth of starveling
labour and dry sterility&mdash;formed to inherit
his hell of paradise. To extend the asperity
of this verdict beyond the forms of Albert
Durer, would be equally unjust and ungrateful
to the father of German art, on whom
invention often flashed, whom melancholy
marked for her own, whose influence even on
Italian art was such that he produced a temporary
revolution in the style of the Tuscan
school. Andrea del Sarto and Giacopo da Puntormo
became his imitators and his copyists;
nor was his influence unfelt by Raffaelle himself,
but his Christ led to the Cross (engraved
by E. Sadler),<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> compared with that of the Madonna
del Spasimo, leaves the claim of superiority
doubtful for sublimity and pathos. It is a
likewise probable that we owe the horrors of the
St. Felicitas to the abominations of his Martyr
scenes. The felicity of his organs, the delicacy
of his finger, the freedom and sweep of his
touch, have found an encomiast in the author
of the life prefixed to the Latin edition of his
works. What would have been the result of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
intended interview, when in Italy, with Andrea
Mantegna, had the death of the latter (1505)
not prevented it, is difficult to guess: if some
amelioration, certainly not the entire change
of style, which the uninterrupted study of the
antique, during a long life, had failed to produce
in Andrea himself.</p>

<p class="ph">The forms of Luke of Leyden are the vegetation
of a swamp.</p>

<p class="ph">The forms of Martin Hemskerck are dislocated
lankness.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p class="ph">The forms of Spranger and Goltzius are
blasphemies on art; the monstrous incubations
of dropsied fancy on phlegm run mad. This
verdict, though uniformly true of every male
figure of Goltzius that demanded energy of
exertion, cannot be equally applied to his females,
the features of the face excepted. On
limbs and bodies resembling the antique in elegance
if not correctness, he placed heads with
Dutch features, ideally, often voluptuously
dressed: such are his Venus between Ceres
and Bacchus; and still more his Diana and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Calisto, a composition which in elegance and
dignity excels that of Tiziano. In the dreadful
familiarity with which the guardian snake
of the Beotian well approaches the companions
of Cadmus, he has touched the true vein of
terror and its limits, and atoned in some degree
for the loathsome horror that had polluted his
graver, when he condescended to copy the abominable
process of that scene from the design
of Pistor.</p>

<p class="ph">The male forms of Rubens are the brawny
pulp of slaughtermen, his females are hillocks
of roses: overwhelmed muscles, dislocated
bones, and distorted joints are swept along in a
gulph of colours, as herbage, trees and shrubs
are whirled, tossed, or absorbed by vernal inundation.</p>

<p class="ph">The female forms of Rembrandt are prodigies
of deformity; his males are the crippled
produce of shuffling industry and sedentary
toil.</p>

<p class="ph">The line of Vandycke is balanced between
Flemish corpulence and English slenderness.</p>

161. The difficulty of physiognomy is to
separate the essence from accident, growth
from excrescence.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">162. He who aims at the sublime, consults
the classes assigned to character by physiognomy,

<p class="ph">163. None ever escaped from himself by
crossing seas; none ever peopled a barren fancy

by excursions into the deserts of mythology or
allegory.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">164. The principles of allegory and votive
composition are the same; they unite with
equal right the most distant periods of time
and the most opposite modes of society: both
surround a real being, or allude to a real act,
with symbols by long general consent adopted,
as expressive of the qualities, motives, and circumstances
that distinguished or gave evidence
to the person or the transaction. Such is the
gallery of the Luxembourg, such the Attila of
the Vatican.</p>

165. Pure history rejects allegory.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The armed figure of Rome, with
Fortune behind her frowning at Coriolanus,
surrounded by the Roman matrons in the
Volscian camp (by Poussin), is a vision seen by
that warrior, and not an allegory; it is a sublime
image, which, without diminishing the credibility
of the fact, adds to its importance, and
raises the hero, by making him submit, not to
the impulse of private ties, but to the destiny
of his country.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">166. All ornament ought to be allegoric.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">167. Dignity is the salt of art.</p>

<p class="ph"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;In the Salutation of Michael Angelo,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
the angelic messenger emerges from
solitary twilight, his countenance seems to
labour with the awful message, and his knees
to bend as he approaches the mysterious personage:
with virgin majesty and humble grace
Mary bows to the extended arm of the lucid
herald, as if waked from sacred meditation,
and appears entranced by celestial sounds.</p>

<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
The Madonnas of Raffaelle, whether hailed
parents of a God, or pressing the divine offspring
to their breast, whether receiving him
from his slumbers, or contemplating his infant
motions, are uniformly transcripts from the
daily domestic images of common life and of
some favourite face matronized: the eyes of his
Fornarina beamed with other fires than those
of sanctity; the sense and native dignity of her
lover could veil their fierceness, but not change
their language.</p>

<p class="ph">The Madonna of Titiano receives her celestial
visitant under an open portico of Palladian
structure, and skirted by gay gardens; the usual
ray precedes the floating angel; gold-ringleted
and in festive attire, he waves a lily wand: in
sable weeds the Virgin receives the gorgeous
homage, proudly devout, like a young abbess
amidst her cloistered lambs.</p>

<p class="p2bh">Tintoretto has turned salutation into irruption.
The angel bursts through the shattered
casement and terrifies a vulgar female; but his
wings are tipped in heaven.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

168. Dignity gives probability to the impossible:
we listen to the monstrous tale of Ulysses
with all the devotion due to a creed. By
dignity, even deformity becomes an instrument
of art: Vulcan limps like a god at the hand of
Homer: the hump and withered arm of Richard
are engines of terror or persuasion in Shakspeare;
the crook-back of Michael Angelo
strikes with awe.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">169. Luxuriance of ornament destroys simplicity
and repose, the attendants of dignity.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;"Simon Mosca, one of the most distinguished
sculptors of ornament and foliage
in the sixteenth century, when proposed by
Vasari to embellish by his designs the monument
of the Cardinal di Monte, was discountenanced
by Michael Angelo on this
principle." <span class="padleft">Vasari</span>, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vita de Simone Mosca</span>.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">170. Judge not an artist from the exertions
of accidental vigour or some unpremeditated
flights of fancy, but from the uniform tenor,
the never-varying principle of his works: the
line and style of Titian sometimes expand
themselves like those of Michael Angelo; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
heads and groups of Raphael sometimes glow
and palpitate with Titiano's tints; and there are
masses of both united in Correggio: but if you
aim at character, let Raphael be your guide; if
at colour, Tiziano; if harmony allure, Correggio:
they indulged in alternate excursions, but never
lost sight of their own domain.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;No one, of whatever period of art,
of whatever eminence or school, out-told Rembrandt
in telling the story of a subject, in the
choice of its real crisis, in simplicity, in perspicuity:
still, as the vile crust that involves
his ore, his local vulgarity of style, the ludicrous
barbarity of his costume, prepossess eyes
less penetrating than squeamish against him,
it requires some confidence to place him with
the classics of invention. Yet with all these
defects, with every prejudice or superiority of
taste and style against him, what school has
produced a work (M. Angelo's Creation of
Adam, and the Death of Ananias by Raffaelle
excepted,) which looks not pale in the superhuman
splendour that irradiates his conception
of Christ before Pilate, unless it be the raising
of Lazarus by Lievens, a name comparatively
obscure, whose awful sublimity reduces the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
same subject as treated by Rembrandt and Sebastian
of Venice, to artificial parade or common-place?</p>

<p class="ph">171. Tone is the moral part of colour.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">172. If tone be the legitimate principle of
colour, he who has not tone, though he should
excel in individual imitation, colours in fragments
and produces discord.</p>

<p class="ph">173. Harmony of colour consists in the due
balance of all, equally remote from monotony
and spots.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">174. The eye tinges all nature with its own
hue. The eye of the Dutch and Flemish schools,
though shut to forms, tipped the cottage, the
boor, the ale-pot, the shambles, and even the
haze of winter, with orient hues and the glow
of setting suns.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">175. Clearness, freshness, force of colour,

than a mixture of many.</p>

<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
176. Colour affects or delights like sound.
Scarlet or deep crimson rouses, determines, invigorates
the eye, as the war-horn or the trumpet
the ear; the flute soothes the ear, as pale
celestial blue or rosy red the eye.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">177. The colours of sublimity are negative
or generic&mdash;such is the colouring of Michael
Angelo.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">178. The passions that sway features and
limbs equally reside, fluctuate, flash and lower
in colour.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">179. The colours of pleasure and love are
hues.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">180. The colour of gravity, reverie, solemnity,
approaches to twilight.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">181. Colour in Raffaelle was the assistant of
expression; to Titian it was the vehicle of
truth; Correggio made it the minister of harmony.
It was sometimes seized, and though
reluctant held, but oftener neglected by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
first; it was embraced, it domineered over, it
coalesced with the second; it attended the third
like an enchanted spirit.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">182. Lodovico Carracci was the first who
gave in oil the colours of gravity, the dignified
twilight of cloistered meditation.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">183. Annibale Carracci, from want of feelings,
though impressed by a grave principle, changed
the mild evening-ray of his master to the bleak
light of a sullen day.</p>
<hr class="r5" />

to position and gradation than to its intrinsic
value.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">185. The colour of Titian is the most independent
of surrounding objects; their union may
assist, but their discrepance cannot destroy it.
</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>186. The harmony of Correggio is independent
of colour.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">187. Historic colour imitates, but copies not.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">188. The portrait-painter copies the colour
of his object, but chooses the medium through
which that object is seen.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">189. The mixtures that anticipate the beauties
of time are big with the seeds of premature
decay.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">190. The colours of health are neither cadaverous
nor flushed like meteors.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">191. There are works whose effect is entirely
founded on the contrast of tints, of what is
termed warm and cold colour, and on reflected
hues: strip them of this charm, reduce them to
the principles of light and shade and masses,
and as far as the want of those can degrade a
picture, they will be fit to take their places on
sign-posts.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">192. Him who has freshness without frigidity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
who glows without being adust, whose
tints luxuriate though not fermented by putrefaction;
who is juicy yet not clammy, though
broad not empty, sharp without dryness, clear
not pellucid, airy not volatile, without being
clumsy plump&mdash;him you may venture to call a
colourist.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">193. Breadth is not vacuity&mdash;Breadth might
easily be obtained if emptiness could give it.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">194. The forms of virtue are erect, the forms
of pleasure undulate: Minerva's drapery descends
in long uninterrupted lines; a thousand
amorous curves embrace the limbs of Flora.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">195. Subordination is the character of drapery.
The heraldry of dress, the rows of aggregated
mitres and pontifical trappings, are noticed
only for the sake of their wearers in the
compositions of the Vatican.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The superiority of style in drapery
over that of the limbs which it covers in the
earliest essays of art after its restoration, is not
accounted for by the assertion that it is transcribed
from the antique: if it is, by what
unaccountable perverseness did the forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the nudities uniformly escape observation? In
painting, this dissonance continues more or
less offensively from the epoch of Cimabue to
that of Masaccio, and, him excepted, down to
Pinturicchio; and ceases not to shock us in
sculpture from the Pisani, to the appearance
of Lorenzo Ghiberti. Nor did that style of
drapery mark only the productions of Italian
art; on this side of the Alps it invested that
of Germany, from the Angels and Madonnas
of Martin Schongaver and Albert Durer, to
those of Aldegraver and Sebald Behm: in nearly
all their performances, Trans and Cisalpine,
the wearer is the appendix of his garment,
chucked into vestments not his own, a dwarfish
thief hid in a giant's robe.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">196. Raffael's drapery is the assistant of character;
in Michael Angelo it envelopes grandeur;
it is in Rubens the ponderous robe of
pomp.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">207. Modesty.&mdash;The touchstone of genuine
modesty is the attention paid to criticism, and
the temper with which it is received, or its
advice adopted; the most arrogant pretence,
the most fiery ambition, the most towering
conceit, may fence themselves with smoothness,
silence and submissive looks&mdash;Oil, the smoothest
of substances, swims on all.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">208. Praise.&mdash;Despise all praise but what he
gives who has been praised for similar efforts;
or his whose interest it is to blame.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">209. Emulation.&mdash;The vindication of the innate
powers, of the individual dignity of man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
careless of appendages and accidental advantage,
grasps the substance of its object.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">210. Envy, the bantling of desperate self-love,
grasps the appendages, heedless of things.
Emulation embalms the dead; Envy the vampire,
blasts the living.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">211. Flattery, the midwife of half-born conceits
and struggling wishes, sometimes persuades,
a boy that he is a man, a dwarf that he
is a giant, but too often enervates the limbs of
energy.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">212. Vanity.&mdash;The vain is the most humble
of mortals: the victim of a pimple.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">213. Those reduced to live on the alms of
genius, are the first to deny its existence.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">214. Shakspeare is to Sophocles what the

216. The women of Michael Angelo are
the sex.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Eve emerging from the side of
Adam; Eve reclining under the tree of knowledge,
in the Capella Sistina; the figures of
Night and Dawn on the tombs of the Medici,
are pure generic forms, little discriminated by
character, and more expressive by action than
emotion of features; solidity without heaviness
separates them from the females in the Last
Judgment, which, with the exception of the
Madonna and St. Catharine, are less beholden
to grace than anatomy. The Cartoon of the
Leda proves that he was not inattentive to the
detail of female charms, but beauty did not
often visit his slumbers, guide his hand, or interrupt
the gravity of his meditation.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">217. The women of Raffaelle are either his
own mistress, or mothers.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;This relates chiefly to his Madonnas&mdash;Of
his saints the St. Cecilia at Bologna
has most of antique beauty, and, whether imitated
or conceived, resembles the Niobe; but
pride is absorbed in devotion, she is the enraptured
victim of divine love, and glows with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
celestial fire: the goddesses of the Farnesina,
however gracefully imagined, are too ponderous
for a&euml;rial forms and amorous conceits.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">218. The women of Correggio are seraglio
beauties.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;The enchantment of the Magdalen,
in the picture of the St. Jerome in the Pilotta
at Parma, is produced by chiaroscuro and attitude.
Sensuality personified is the general
character of his females, and the grace of his
children, less naivet&eacute; than grimace, the caricature
of jollity.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">219. The women of Titiano are the plump,
fair, marrowy Venetian race.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Venus taking a reluctant farewell
of Adonis; Diana starting at the intrusion of
Acteon, with every allure of attitude, with
heads dressed by the Graces, are local beauties,
sink under the weight of Venetian limbs, and
are only distinguished by contrast from the
model that plumped herself down for his
Danae. The reposing figure commonly called
the Venus of the Tribuna, is an exquisite
portrait of some favourite female, but not a
Venus.
</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>220. The women of Parmegiano are coquettes.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">221. The women of Annibale Carracci are
made up by imitation and vulgarity.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Venus with Anchises, Juno with
Jupiter, Omphale with Hercules, Diana and
Calisto in the Farnese gallery, owe their charms
and dignity of action to imitation; the celebrated
three Maries, Magdalen penitent in her
hempen shroud, are the conceptions of his own
mind.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">222. The women of Guido are actresses.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">223. The forms of Domenichino's female
faces are ideal; their expression is poised between
pure helpless virginity and sainted
ecstasy.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">224. The veiled eyes of Guercino's females
dart insidious fire.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">225. Such is the fugitive essence, such the
intangible texture of female genius, that few
combinations of circumstances ever seemed to
favour its transmission to posterity.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
226. In an age of luxury women have taste,
decide and dictate; for in an age of luxury woman
aspires to the functions of man, and man
slides into the offices of woman. The epoch of
eunuchs was ever the epoch of viragoes.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">227. Female affection is ever in proportion to
the impression of superiority in the object. Woman
fondles, pities, despises and forgets what is
below her; she values, bears and wrangles with
her equal; she adores what is above her.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">228. Be not too squeamish in the choice of
your materials; you will disgrace the best, if
you cannot give value to the worst: the gold
and azure wasted on Rosselli's<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> draperies cannot
give value to their folds or hide the wants
beneath.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">229. There are moments when all are men,
and only men, and ought to be no more;
but the artist, who when his daily task is over
can lock his meditation up with his tools&mdash;ranks
with mechanics.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">230. Date the death of emulation and of excellence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
from the moment of your employer's
indifference; and mediocrity of success from
the moment of his meddling with the process
of your work.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">231. One of the most unexplored regions
of art are dreams, and what may be called the
personification of sentiment: the Prophets, Sibyls
and Patriarchs of Michael Angelo are so
many branches of one great sentiment. The
dream of Raffaello is a characteristic representation
of a dream; the dream of Michael Angelo
is moral inspiration, a sublime sentiment.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Of three visionary subjects ascribed
to Raffaello and known from the prints of
Marc Antonio, Georgio Mantuano, and Agostino
Veneziano, this alludes to the last, called
by the Italians <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Stregozzo</span>, by the French "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Carcasse</span>:" an association of ideas big with the
very elements of dreams, and almost a definition.
That it be a conception of Raffaello rests
on no other proof than the tablet of Marc Antonio
and its own internal merit; which is so
uniform that although one principal figure is
undoubtedly transcribed from another in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
cartoon of Pisa, the whole can never be considered
as a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">pasticcio</span>.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">232. A trite subject becomes interesting by
the introduction of appropriate ornaments; a
small statue of Moses breaking the tables in
the back-ground of a Salutation; and a number
of Baptists in that of a Madonna with her
son and Joseph, expressing the dissolution of
the old and the institution of the new doctrine,
both by Michael Angelo,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> give unexpected
sublimity to subjects for which Raffaelle and
Titiano had ransacked in vain the nursery and
heaven.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">233. Compilation is the lowest degree in art,
but let him who means to borrow with impunity,
follow the statesman's maxim: "strip the
mean and spare the great."</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;A composition of which every thing
was borrowed from himself, being shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Michael Angelo, and his opinion asked, "I
commend it," said he, "but when on the day of
judgement each body shall claim its original
limbs, what will remain in this picture?"</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">234. He ought to possess some himself, who
attempts to make use of borrowed excellence:
a golden goblet on a beggar's table, serves only
to expose its companions of lead.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">235. Resemblance, character, costume, are
the three requisites of portrait: the first distinguishes,
the second classifies, the third assigns
place and time to an individual.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">236. Landscape is either the transcript of a
spot, or a picturesque combination of homogeneous
objects, or the scene of a phenomenon.
The first pleases by precision and taste; the second
adds variety and grandeur; the third may
be an instrument of sublimity, affect our passions,
or wake a sentiment.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">237. Selection is the invention of the landscape
painter.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
238. He never can be great who honours
what is little.</p>

<p class="p2bh"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Grandeur of style and execution do
not exclusively depend upon dimensions: but
in an age and amidst a race who have erected
littleness or rather diminutiveness of size to the
only credentials of admissibility into collections,
to the passports without which Raffaelle
himself finds it difficult to penetrate the sanctuaries
of pigmy art, that which ennobled the
age of Pericles, of Julio, and Leone, must be
content to look to posterity for its reward. If
it were physiognomically true, that the structure
of every human face bears some analogy
to that of some brute, it might reasonably surprise,
that an individual marked by nature
with no very remote resemblance to a Hippopotamus,
should be considered as the legislator
of a taste equally noted for tameness of conception
and effeminate finish; but as it is improbable
that one individual, however favoured by
circumstances or endowed with all-persevering
activity, or arrogance, could stamp the taste of
a nation exclusively with his own, it may be
fairly surmised that he did no more than find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and rear the seeds of that Micromania which
infects the public taste.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="ph">239. The medium of poetry is time and action;
that of the plastic arts, space and figure.
Poetry then is at its summit, when its hand
arrests time and embodies action: and these,
when they wing the marble or the canvass,
and from the present moment dart rays back
to the past and forward to the future.</p>

<p class="p2bhx"><i>Coroll.</i>&mdash;Subjects are positive, negative, repulsive.
The first are the proper materials, the
voluntary servants of invention; to the second
she gives interest and value; from the last she
can escape only by the help of execution, for
execution alone can palliate her defeat by the
last. The Laocoon, the H&aelig;mon and Antigone,
the Niobe and her daughters, the death of
Ananias, the Sacrifice at Lystra, Elymas struck
blind, are positive subjects, speak their meaning
with equal evidences to the scholar and the unlettered
man, and excite the sympathy due to
the calls of terror and pity with equal energy
in every breast. St. Jerome presenting the
translation of his Bible to the Infant Jesus, St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Peter at the feet of the Madonna receiving the
thanksgivings of victorious Venice, with every
other votive altar-piece, little interesting to
humanity in general, owe the impression they
make on us to the dexterous arrangement, the
amorous or sublime enthusiasm of the artist;&mdash;but
we lament to see invention waste its
powers, and execution its skill, to excite our
feelings for an action or event that receives its
real interest from a motive which cannot be
rendered intuitive; such as Alceste expiring,
the legacy of Eudamidas, the cause of Demetrius's
disorder.</p>

<p class="lecture">THE TUSCAN SCHOOL.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> analogy of style observable in the
figures impressed on Tuscan coins of the tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth century, and those found
in the miniatures that decorate the manuscripts
of the contemporary periods, proves that Tuscany
had its artists long before the epoch which
Vasari and his copyists fix for the importation
of Greek art with Greek artists: whether those
paintings be all pure Tuscan, or here and there
interspersed with Greek ones, none will venture
to decide, who knows the impossibility of
drawing a limitary line sufficiently severe to
distinguish the last spasms of an expiring art
from the first stammerings of an infant one.
Of the still surviving monuments of painting
during those epochs, it may be sufficient to mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the famed Christ, painted on canvass and
glued to a wooden cross, of a date anterior to
1003.</p>

<p>In subsequent times, the earliest and least
unsuccessful essays in art, were made by the
Pisano. Whilst a Greek sarcophagus at Pisa,
storied with the incidents of Hippolytus and
Ph&aelig;dra, furnished some elements of form to the
sculptors Niccolo and Giovanni Pisano, painting
made some progress with Giunta Pisano:
his composition of Christ on the Cross at the
Angeli of Assisi, though defective in design,
possesses life and expression.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>A similar progress was made by his contemporary
Guido or Guidone of Sienna; a name
not mentioned by Vasari, though in his frequent
excursions to Sienna, he could not remain
unacquainted with the works of Guido, at least
one which still exists in the chapel of the Malevolti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in S. Dominico, with the following often
repeated inscription and date:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>This Madonna, twenty years anterior to the
birth of Cimabue, is superior to his Madonna
in expression, and nearly equal in taste and
colour, though inferior in style.</p>

<p>Duccio di Boninsegna, probably of his school,
was celebrated as the restorer of that inlaid
kind of Mosaic, called "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lavoro di Commesso</span>."
His works are from 1275, the year in which he
received a commission for S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria Novella at
Florence, to 1311, the period at which he was
employed in the Domo of Sienna. If these dates
be genuine, he can scarcely have lived till 1357,
the year at which Fiorillo fixes his death. It
is not probable that he should have stretched
his span beyond a century, which must have
been the case, if we suppose that he was twenty
at the time he painted in S. Maria Novella; it
is not probable that he should have chosen, or
been suffered, to remain idle with the celebrity
he had acquired in the labours of the Domo;
and it is still less probable, that, if he was employed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
what he produced in the interval, between
that period and his death, should have
perished or been destroyed, whilst we are still
in possession of the paintings in the Domo,
which made nearly an epoch in art, at which
he laboured three years, for which he was paid
upwards of 3000 <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">scudi d'oro</span>, the expense of
gilding and ultramarine included. That part
of it which faced the audience, represented in
large figures the Madonna and various saints;
that which fronted the choir, divided into many
compartments, exhibited numerous compositions
of Gospel subjects in figures of small proportion;
it cannot be denied, that with all its
copiousness, the whole savours strongly of the
Greek manner.</p>

<p>Andrea Taffi, born 1213, the scholar of
Apollonius, a Greek painter, and his assistant
in some mosaics at S. Giovanni of Florence,
is not mentioned out of that line by Vasari
and Baldinucci: but the discovery of a picture
with his name by Ignazio Stugford adds
another legitimate name to the predecessors of
Cimabue.</p>

<p>Buonamico di Cristofano, or Buffalmacco, of
facetious memory, was the pupil of Taffi. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
best works are lost, but from the remains it
may be suspected that he owes at least as much
to the tales of Boccaccio and Sacchetti, for the
preservation of his name, as to his own powers.
There still exists in Campo Santo at Pisa, a
fresco of the Creation with a God Father
five ells high, supporting Heaven and the elements;
and three other stories of Adam, Noah
and his Sons; a Crucifix, a Resurrection, and
an Ascension. We must not look here for
much symmetry of design or Giottesque elegance;
his heads have little variety, and less
beauty; sameness of features, a vulgar cast, and
a gaping deformity of mouth, characterize his
women; but now and then attention rests on
the vivacity or physiognomy of some male
countenance, especially that of Cain. Sometimes
he snatches some movement from nature,
such as that of the terrified man who flies from
Calvary: he overflows in particoloured drapery,
and delights in laboured ornaments of
flowers and lace. A St. John the Baptist of
his, yet existing, deserves to be mentioned as
an instance of the utility of comparing works in
painting and sculpture with contemporary coins,
in order to ascertain their dates; for the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
figure is exactly repeated on the Florentine
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">scudo d'oro</span> of that age. A jocular host of
artists, scholars of this school, we pass over, as
more important to the reader of the Decamerone
and the Novelle, than to the student
of art.</p>

<p>Lucca, about 1235, possessed Bonaventura
Berlingieri, whose St. Francis still exists in the
castle of Guiglia, near Modena, and is described
as a work of considerable merit for its time:
Margaritone of Arezzo, a pupil and follower of
the Greeks, appears to have been several years
anterior to Cimabue. He painted on canvass,
and was the first, according to Vasari, who
found the method of giving a more solid texture
to pictures. Some crucifix of his is still
seen at Arezzo, and another at Santa Croce in
Florence, facing one of Cimabue. The style
of both is antiquated, but not so different in
merit to make us refuse a painter's name to
Margaritone if we grant it to Cimabue.</p>

<p>Giovanni Cimabue,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> of noble lineage, was an
architect and painter. He is considered as the
father of Italian art, because with him legitimate
history and a less interrupted series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
dates, begin; because he succeeded better than
his predecessors in disentangling himself from
the shackles of Greek barbarity, and chiefly because
he discovered and called forth the genius
of Giotto. Vasari may be right in making him
the scholar of those Greeks whom the Florentine
Government had employed to paint the
Church of Santa Maria Novella; but he errs in
placing them in the Chapel Gondi, which, with
the body of the church, was not erected till the
subsequent century; he should have assigned
them another chapel under the church, where
time has discovered some vestiges of ancient
painting. It seems, however, more probable,
that Giunta Pisano gave Cimabue instruction,
if it be ascertained, as Fiorillo asserts, that he
worked in the great church of Assisi, 1253,
when he was in his thirteenth year, and Giunta
superintended the decorations of that fabric.</p>

<p>The pompous visit which Charles of Anjou
paid to Cimabue in passing through Florence,
sufficiently proves the celebrity he enjoyed,
if it has not been sanctioned by the authority of
Dante, who calls him the unrivalled champion of
his day. Cimabue was then painting the Madonna
with the Infant adored by six angels;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the picture when finished was carried in procession
from Borgo Allegro to Santa Maria
Novella, and placed in the Chapel Rucellai,
where it still exists. The heraldic arrangement
of the figures, their physiognomic monotony,
the exility of the detail and barbarous
execution, contrast strangely with the elevation
and novelty of the artist's conception. Cimabue
lost the female and the mother in the
Queen of Heaven. Insensible to the blandishments
of beauty, fierce like the age in which he
lived, he excelled in male, especially aged characters;
these he impressed with something of
a stern grandeur, not often surpassed since.
Vast and comprehensive in his ideas, he seized
on subjects of numerous composition, and expressed
them in large proportions; those features
of prophetic grandeur which surprise in
his frescoes at the Dominicans and Santa Trinit&agrave;
of Florence, are still excelled by the features
which he displayed in the upper church of
Assisi&mdash;meteors of the age in which he lived.
They still exist, nor is it easily conceived how
works of so different style, against the testimony
of Vasari, and the uniform tradition of
five centuries, could, as they were of late, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
ascribed to the more regulated hand and
gentler spirit of Giotto.</p>

<p>Giotto's year of birth has been disputed; Vasari
fixes it to 1276, Baldinucci to 1265. He
was the son of a cottager at Vespignano, and
bred to be a shepherd; but, a painter born, he
amused himself from infancy with attempts to
draw whatever object struck his fancy. A
sheep which he had copied on a flat stone
caught the eye of Cimabue, who was in the
neighbourhood, happened to pass by, demanded
him of his father, and carried him to Florence
to instruct him; but he soon rivalled, and in a
short time eclipsed his master by a grace and
an amenity of execution which remained unequalled
to the time of Masaccio.</p>

<p>For the rapidity of this progress, unless we
were to ascribe it to inspiration, we must account
from the happy coincidence of external
advantages with the genius of the man. A
period so obscure, admits of little more than
conjecture, but there is no improbability in
supposing that Giotto outstripped his master
and the times by the same means which rendered
Michael Agnolo so soon superior to Ghirlandaio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
&mdash;modelling and the study of the antique.
We know that he was a sculptor, and
that his models still existed in the time of Lorenzo
Ghiberti. Good originals he could find
among the fragments of antiquity discovered
before his time, and scattered over Florence
and Rome: from what other source could
he derive the character of his male heads, and
that squareness of form so different from the
exility and indecision of all contemporary
styles? The few majestic natural folds of
his draperies, and the composure and unaffected
air of his figures, breathe the spirit of
the antique. His very defects are the consequences
of such a study. His manner has
been charged with a kind of <i>statuine</i> precision
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">del statuino</span>), unknown to other schools,
and unknown to artists who do not form themselves
on the antique.</p>

<p>If to these conjectures it be objected, that
the want of uniformity, dryness of design, extremities
either faulty or hid under a preposterous
length of drapery, rather betray a nurseling
of Pisa than a pupil of the ancients; it ought
to be considered that uniformity is the result of
settled principles; that he who had to remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the rubbish could not be expected to give the
polish; that he who had to teach eyes to look,
hands to move, and feet to stand, could not be
supposed to make them do it with all the
correctness, propriety or elegance, they were
capable of; that a certain gymnophobia equally
attends the infancy and the decrepitude of
taste, and that the approbation of a public and
an artist's flattery are always reciprocal.</p>

<p>And no artist commanded more of public
favour than Giotto. Legislator of taste, not in
Tuscany alone, but at Rome, Naples, Bologna,
and the Venetian State, he excelled his master
as much in celebrity as he had excelled him in
grace and method. How soon he did this
may be seen on comparing his earliest works
at Assisi with those of his master in the same
place. Genuine elements of composition, expressions
inspired by Nature, accuracy of design,
progressively appear. It is no hyperbole
to affirm, that in certain characters no artist
ever went nearer the source of expression than
Giotto, and that in the maiden airs of untainted
virginity none ever excelled, and perhaps, Raphael
and Domenichino excepted, few ever
approached him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Though not the inventor, Giotto was the
restorer of portrait-painting; resemblance, with
character of face and attitude, date from him.
He gave us Dante, Brunetto Latini, Corso Donato,
&amp;c. Mosaic was improved by him, and
his powers in it shown by the celebrated Navicella,
or boat of Saint Peter, in the portico of
the Basilica at Rome; though restoration has
transformed it to a work of shreds and patches,
and reduced his claim on it to the mere name.
Missal painting likewise owes him some gratitude;
and in architecture the grand steeple of
the Domo at Florence is the work of Giotto.</p>

<p>Implicit imitation checks progress; the numerous
school of Giotto were for the greater
part content to walk behind their master. Taddeo
Gaddi, the most familiar and most favoured
of his pupils, is said by Vasari, whom time still
suffered to judge with some competence, to
have excelled him in colouring and mellowness.
The works of Taddeo in S<sup>ta</sup>. Croce are inferior
in originality and execution to his compositions
in the Capitolo degli Spagnuoli, where, in the
ceiling, he represented some Gospel subjects, and
in the Cenacolo the Descent of the Holy Spirit,
one of the beautiful relics of the fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
century. On the sides he painted the Sciences,
with their most eminent professors under each,
no unfair specimen of poetic conception; here
is what remains of vivacity and brightness in
his tints. Taddeo outlived the period assigned
him by Vasari; we find him mentioned
as late as 1352, which still might not be the
ultimate date of his life.</p>

<p>Another conspicuous name among his pupils
is Stefano of Florence, (Fiorentino,) whom Vasari,
without hesitation, in every part of the art
prefers to his master. He was the son of one
Catharina, a daughter of Giotto; an ardent and
inquisitive spirit, quick to discover and eager
to overcome difficulties; the first who ventured
on foreshortening, and if success did not fully
second his efforts in that, it favoured him in
perspective, which he much improved, and in
the attitudes, variety and vivacity of heads.
Landino fancied to compliment his memory by
repeating the silly epithet of "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scimia della
Natura</span>," "Ape of Nature," which, from the
resemblance of his portraits, was given him by
the vulgar and the dilettanti of his day. His
works in Ara C&#339;li at Rome, at S. Spirito of
Florence, and elsewhere, perished, and nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
can safely be stamped with his name, if it be
not a Madonna in Campo Santo at Pisa, grander
in style than those of his master, but retouched.</p>

<p>Of Tommaso, his son and reputed scholar, a
Piet&agrave;, which might be taken for a work of
Giotto, exists at S. Remigi of Florence; and
still some frescoes at Assisi. They entitle him
to the surname of "Giottino," given him by
his fellow-citizens, who used to say that the
spirit of Giotto had passed into him and animated
his hand.</p>

<p>Without embarrassing ourselves with conjectures
on Ugolino da Sienna, we pass to the more
celebrated name of Simone Memmi, or Simon di
Martino, a native of the same place, the painter
of Laura, and the friend of Petrarca, who in
two affected sonnets has transmitted him to
posterity. Whether Simone were the pupil of
Maestro Mino as the Siennese, or of Giotto as
the Florentine writers pretend, is a point beyond
decision: he restored a picture of the first,
and his style has some analogy to that of the
second, though with more suavity of colour, and
more poetry of conception. He was the first
who dared to fill a spacious fa&ccedil;ade with one
composition without dividing it into compartments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Such is that in the Capitolo degli
Spagnuoli of Santa Maria Novella at Florence,
where Vasari discovered every beauty of his
own time, and where, in the crowd of introduced
portraits, many have fancied, in spite of
chronology, to discover the portraits of Laura
and her friend; whom probably he did not
become personally acquainted with till four
years after the completion of that work, 1336,
when he was sent to the Pope at Avignon, became
familiar with Petrarca, painted Laura,
and, strange to tell, reached the expectation of
the lover, who saw</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:4em">"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il lampegiar dell' angelico riso</span>."</span>
</p>

<p>Miniature, though the last object of this work,
was not the least of Memmi's powers. Lanzi
has noticed one which fronts a MS. Virgil with
the commentary of Servius, now in the Ambrosiana
at Milan, but formerly possessed by
Petrarca, who probably dictated the subject,
and added the following lines:-</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:4em"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mantua Virgilium qui talia carmina finxit,</span><br /></span>
<span style="margin-left:4em"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sena tulit Simonem digito qui talia pinxit</span>.</span>
</p>

<p>The painting represents Virgil in a sitting attitude
ready to write, with his face turned upwards
as invoking the Muse. &AElig;neas, in martial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
vest and attitude, stands before him, and
pointing to his sword, alludes to the subject of
the &AElig;neis, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arma Virumque</span>." A shepherd
and a husbandman, symbols of the Pastorals
and Georgics, placed somewhat lower, listen to
the theme; whilst Servius draws a transparent
curtain, to denote his labours in unveiling the
beauties and removing the obscurities of the
poet. In this miniature, the originality of conception,
the beauty and harmony of colour, the
varied and appropriate drapery, are, however,
balanced by rudeness of design, vulgarity of
character, and deformed extremities.</p>

<p>It was a barbarous singularity of Simone,
promiscuously to admit different proportions
on the same plane: to flank or cross figures
of natural size with figures a third less than
nature.</p>

<p>Lippo, or Filippo Memmi, was the relative,
scholar, and imitator, of Simone: assisted
by his designs, Lippo often executed works,
which, had he not marked them with his name,
would be ascribed to the master: when left to
his own invention, he rose in nothing above
mediocrity, but in colour. Sometimes they
were partners in the same picture, as in that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
S. Ansano di Castel Vecchio, at Sienna; sometimes
the second finished what the first began,
as in some works at Ancona and Assisi; and at
Sienna there remains still something entirely
executed by Lippo.</p>

<p>Simone co-operated in the works of S. Maria
Novella with Taddeo Gaddi, who, with his
son, Angelo Gaddi, left a number of pupils,
imitators through him of Giotto, inferior to
both, not much distinguished by tradition,
and less favoured by time. Of Jacopo di
Casentino, the most conspicuous, what vestiges
remain in the church of Orsanmichele at
Florence, are in conformity with the style of
Taddeo; barriers soon overleaped by the vivid
fancy of his scholar, Spinello the Aretine, whom
his own conception of a demon is said to have
terrified into insanity and death. His son,
Parri Spinelli, with barbarous incongruities of
line, possessed exquisite colour; and his pupil,
Lorenzo di Bicci, has been compared to
Vasari, for the number, dispatch, and opinion
of his works. Antonio, surnamed Veneziano,
whether he were a Venetian or a Florentine, is,
against evidence of dates and style, supposed
to have been a pupil of Angelo Gaddi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and to have educated Paolo Uccello, the first
master of perspective, and Gherardo Starnina,
an artist of gay style, whose relics live still
a chapel of S<sup>ta</sup>. Croce. They are numbered
among the last productions of Giotto's expiring
epoch, and the verge of the fourteenth
century, in which we have still to mark,
though pupils of some other school, the
family of Orcagna; Bernardo, a painter; Jacopo,
a sculptor; but chiefly Andrea, conspicuous for
writing, painting, sculpture, and architecture,
in a degree little inferior to Giotto himself.
Architects date from him the abolition of the
acute angle and restoration of semicircular
arches, as in the Loggia of the Lanzi, which
he likewise decorated with sculpture. Some,
without attention to time, have supposed
him the pupil of Angelo Gaddi, but he was
probably trained to the art by his brother
Bernardo, jointly with whom he painted in
the Capella Strozzi of S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria Novella, in
the Campo Santo at Pisa, and alone and better
in S<sup>ta</sup>. Croce, Death, Judgement, Paradise,
and Hell, placing with Dantesque licence his
friends among the elect, his enemies with the
damned.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The downfall of Pisa had raised Florence to
the metropolis of Tuscany, and the spirit of its
citizens to render its appearance worthy of that
pre-eminence. Cosmo, styled the father of his
country, who tuned the public affairs, might
with better right have been called the father
of distinguished talents: never was tyranny
meditated on a less suspicious plan, or approached
by more popular means. The house of the
Medici, in the quaint Italian phrase, became
the Lyceum of Philosophers, the Arcadia of
Poets, the Academy of Artists. Dello, Paolo,
Masaccio, the two Peselli, both the Lippi,
Benozzo, Sandro, the Ghirlandai, were the clients
of the family, and emulated each other in
their homage. Their pictures, according to the
usage of the age, full of portraits, perpetually
presented to the people likenesses of the Medici,
and often in the characters of the Magi royally
robed, the sceptre firmly held in the gripe of
the Medici, to prepare the public eye gradually
for what it was soon to witness, the firm establishment
of sovereignty in that House. The
competition of rival citizens, and still more the
wide-extended influence of religion, diffused
Taste and beckoned Talent to Florence as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
its centre, from every part of Italy. At her
call Donatello, Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Filarete,
the Rossellini, Verrocchio arose, and with their
works spread the Elements of Art.</p>

<p>Poetry, that supplies the real features and
materials of expression when it inspires the
thought, arrives at the full display of its powers
long before its sisters have disentangled themselves
from the impediments of infancy; and of
these, Sculpture, whose aim is infinitely less
complex, raises the vigorous fabric of forms,
whilst Painting is still impotently struggling
with the rudiments of line, perspective, keeping,
chiaroscuro, colour; which to unite in
an equal degree has hitherto been found above
the lot of humanity. The imitators of Giotto
were in this state of struggle; they saw little
in chiaroscuro, and less in perspective and line;
their figures still slip from their planes, their
fabrics have no true point of sight, their fore-shortenings
depended solely on the eye:
Stefano dal Ponte rather saw than overcame;
the rest either avoided or palliated these difficulties.
The Umbrian Pietro della Francesca
seems to have been the first who called geometry
to the assistance of painting, and taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
by his works at Arezzo the principles of perspective;
Brunelleschi formed it into system
for architecture, and the mathematician Manetti
roused the attention of Paolo Uccello, who owes
the perpetuity of his name nearly exclusively
to the study of that science. His immoderate
attachment to perspective is become proverbial;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
and almost equalled his fondness for birds, from
which he got his surname. He applied it,
from grounds and buildings, to the human body,
which he foreshortened with a skill unknown
to his predecessors: and some proofs of
it still exist in the figures of God and No&egrave;
among the chiaroscuroes in the chiostro of S<sup>ta</sup>.
Maria Novella, and in the equestrian colossus
of Gio. Aguto (John Montacute), which he
painted in chiaroscuro of terra verde, and which
is still in the duomo. The art, since its revival,
perhaps for the first time showed that, if it had
dared much, it had dared well: nor did he fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
short of it in the gigantic imagery of the
House Vitali at Bologna; he was, however,
more employed in painting private furniture:
the triumphs of Petrarch on some small presses
in the gallery of Florence are supposed to come
from his hand. That he was a master of expression,
the instances adduced by Vasari
leave no doubt; and in describing the flying
drapery of some friar in the series of pictures
relative to S. Benedetto, the same writer tells
us, that it served as a model to all succeeding
artists: to such powers, praise of variety is added
by the truth and diligence with which he
copied trees, plants, birds and animals, and for
which some critic styles him the Bassano of
the first epoch. In the nearly general wreck
of Paolo's works, it is difficult to form a judgment
of his technic character independent of
tradition: but, comparing what remains with
what we are told, it is evident that he reached
from one extreme of the Art to the other; and
that, if he was blameable for frequently playing
with a tool instead of using it, mistaking
an instrument of the Art for Art itself, and
means for the end of execution, he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
deprived by partiality of the praise due to
powers which he appears to have possessed in
a degree unknown to the times that preceded
Masaccio.</p>

<p>Masolino da Panicale cultivated chiaroscuro:
he was enabled to treat it with more truth
than his predecessors, by a long practice of
modelling under the tuition of Lorenzo Ghiberti,
the master of design and grouping in
those days, but whose animation he did not
attain. Starnina instructed him in colour; and
thus by uniting the characteristics of two
schools, he produced that new style, which,
though still infected by dryness and clogged
by inelegance, possesses grandeur, union and
breadth: the proofs still remain in the chapel
of S. Pietro al Carmine, where, besides the
Evangelists, he painted several subjects from
the story of that Apostle. The remaining ones,
which he did not live to finish, were some years
afterward added by his scholar Tomaso Gisioli,
celebrated by the name of Masaccio from his
careless way of living.</p>

<p>Historians, biographers, and poets, unite in
dating a new period from Masaccio. The compass
of his mind led him to uniformity of
pursuit, and the introduction of style; he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
formed his principles on the works of Ghiberti
and Donatello; perspective he had learnt of
Brunelleschi, and in an excursion to Rome, it
is unreasonable to suppose that he did not
improve himself on the antique. Gentile da
Fabriano and Vittore Pisanello were then at
Rome, and the high opinion which they are
said to have expressed of him<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> as the first painter
of the age has been recorded: it is, however,
difficult to say on what that opinion could be
founded: they were too far advanced in life
to see more of Masaccio than his juvenile essays,
perhaps such as the S. Anna in S. Ambrogio at
Florence, or what he painted in the chapel of
St. Catherine, in the church of St. Clemens
of Rome, the figures of the ceiling excepted,
all retouched, and though fine works for the
time, of doubtful authority, and in no manner
to be compared to the pictures del Carmine.
Here appear the virility of his powers and the
legitimacy of his superior claim: here the
figures, however varied by attitude, pose or are
foreshortened with that truth and uniformity
of success which the less established principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of Paolo Uccello did not always reach. In expression,
sublimity distinguishes Donatello; he
always aims at, and sometimes succeeds in personifying
a sentiment or a passion.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Masaccio,
more dramatic, poises expression by character
and propriety; hence he has been said, and
truly said, to resemble Raffaello.</p>

<p>To be praised immoderately for what, with
regard to judgment, deserved it least, has, as of
others, been likewise the lot of Masaccio: the
introduction and masterly execution of the
man who, in the baptism of St. Peter, appears
to shiver with cold, is extolled by Vasari,
and makes, by the verdict of Lanzi, an epoch
in art. Had the apostle immersed the race
of a Northern clime, a man frost-bitten, (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">assiderando
di freddo</i>,) or impatient of cold, might
have been admitted without impropriety, but
under an Asiatic sun he is worse than superfluous.
This either Masaccio did not consider,
or if he did, fondly sacrificed propriety
to the expression of an incident, which, had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
even been admissible, had in itself less dignity,
and incomparably less pathos, than that of the
sick monk on whose eyes and lips the hope of
recovery seemed to tremble, introduced among
the series of pictures from the life of St. Benedict,
by Paolo Uccello.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>A higher and more legitimate praise of Masaccio's
expression is, that Raffaello not only
imitated its general character, but in the same
or similar subjects sometimes individually adopted
it, as in the gesture of Paul in the Cartoon
of the Areopagus, and that of Adam dismissed
from Paradise, in the Loggia; and that, if he
improved the taste and added elegance to the
Tuscan's drapery, he closely adhered to its principles,
simplicity, propriety, and breath.</p>

<p>Of Masaccio's colour, what remains possesses
truth, variety, delicacy, union, and great relief.
He lived not to finish the whole of the Chapel,
some stories still remaining to be added in
1443, the reputed year of his death,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
not without suspicion of having been hastened
by poison. His other frescoes at Florence have
been destroyed by time, and perhaps no gallery
can produce an authentic picture by his hand,
if we except the portrait of a youth in the
Pitti palace, a work that breathes life.</p>

<p>Ghiberti and Donatello had taught Masaccio
to find style by selection from nature; his followers
for half a century, content to look at
him without adhering to his method, gradually
shrunk back to the exility and meagreness of
the preceding age: without embarrassing ourselves
with the angelic prettinesses of Fr&agrave; Giovanni
da Fiesole, a name dearer to sanctity
than to art, and whom both his age and missal-taste
prove the nursling of another school, we
pass to Benozzo Gozzoli, his pupil, who strove
to forget his puny lessons in the bolder dictates
of Masaccio.</p>

<p>That he could not soon do it, is evident from
the profusion of ornamental glitter and tinsel
colouring in the frescoes of the Chapel Riccardi.
He succeeded better at Pisa, where his Scripture
stories cover an entire wing of Campo
Santo. This enormous enterprise, which, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the phrase of Vasari might smite with fear a
legion of painters,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> he is said to have completely
achieved in two years. Everywhere
inferior to his model in composition, design,
and expression, he often goes beyond him in
vastness and amenity of scenery, a certain play
of ideas and picturesque exuberance. After
all, perhaps more than one hand shared in the
execution. Benozzo lived long, and lies buried
near his work, where public gratitude had placed
his sepulchre, and inscribed it with an eulogy.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Filippo Lippi, a Carmelitan friar, studied
and imitated the works of Masaccio, especially
in compositions of small proportion, with great
success. Suavity of conception and colour animates
his angels and Madonnas: in the large
historic frescoes at Pieve di Prato, he introduced
proportions exceeding the natural size,
praised as his masterpieces by Vasari, who has
related Lippi's escape from the convent; his
captivity among the Moors; the pictures which
he painted at Naples, Padoua, and elsewhere;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
his premature death by poison from the relatives
of the female by whom he had a natural
son, Filippino Lippi. Fr&agrave; Filippo died at Spoleti,
1469, on the point of finishing his great
work in the dome, where Lorenzo de' Medici,
who had demanded but not obtained his ashes
from the citizens, entombed them under a
stately monument inscribed by Angelo Poliziano.
His scholars and imitators were F. Diamante
of Prato, the partner of his last work;
F. Pesello of Florence, and Pesellino his son,
whom, if we believe Vasari, shortness of life
alone intercepted from superior excellence.</p>

<p>About this period the first attempts of painting
in oil were made at Florence, by Andrea
dal Castagno, of detested memory, who had improved
himself by looking at Masaccio. Domenico,
called Veneziano, to whom Antonello
of Messina had communicated the novel mystery
of Johan Van Eyk, after practising it with
success at home, Loretto, and other parts of the
Papal State, came to exercise it at Florence:
caressed and encouraged, he excited the envy
and cupidity of Castagno, who under the mask
of submissive attachment, wheedled himself into
his confidence, obtained the secret, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
assassinated the hapless donor. The treacherous
but complete acquisition added lustre to
his practice during life, but time has swept the
sacrilegious produce of his hand, and left nothing
to the memory of "Andrea degli Impiccati,"
but the execration of posterity.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The farther we leave Masaccio behind, the
nearer we approach the golden epoch, the more
lurid becomes the atmosphere of art. Mediocrity,
tinsel ostentation, and tasteless diligence
mark the greater number of that society of
craftsmen whom Sixtus IV. conscribed (1474,
Manni,) to decorate or rather to disfigure the
panels of the grand Chapel which took its name
from him (La Sistina): one of its sides was to
be occupied by subjects from the Pentateuch,
the other by Gospel stories. Pietro Perugino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
excepted, the artists convoked were nearly all
Florentines or Tuscans; viz. Sandro Botticelli,
Domenico Bigordi, Cosimo Rosselli, Luca, Signorelli
of Cortona, and Don Bartolomeo of
Arezzo, with their assistants. The superintendence
of the whole the Pope, with the usual
vanity and ignorance of princes, gave to Sandro,
the least qualified of the group, whose barbarous
taste and dry minuteness palsied, or assimilated
with his own, the powers of his associates,
and rendered the whole a monument of puerile
ostentation, and conceits unworthy of its place.
Nor is it from what there remains of either, that
the names of Luca Signorelli and Domenico Bigordi
claim that attention which history owes
to the first as the real precursor of Michael
Angelo, and to the second as the master of his
rudiments.</p>

<p>Luca Egidio Signorelli, of Cortona,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> less to
be considered as the reviver of Masaccio's style
than as the founder of that which distinguished
the succeeding epoch, might have led its banners,
as his life stretched beyond that of Raphael
and Lionardo, had his principle been more
uniform. The greater part of his works exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the evident struggle of his own perceptions
with the prescriptive ones of his time, and a
kind of coalition between the barbarity of the
expiring and the emancipated taste of the
rising &aelig;ra. The best evidence of this is in the
Duomo of Orvieto, where in the mixed imagery
of final dissolution and infernal punishment, he
has scattered ideas of original conception, character
and attitude, in copious variety, but not
without numerous remnants of Gothic alloy.
The angels who announce the impending doom
or scatter plagues, exhibit with awful simplicity
bold foreshortenings, whilst the St. Michael
presents only the tame heraldic figure and attitude
of a knight all cased in armour. In the
expression of the condemned groups and d&aelig;mons,
he chiefly dwells on the supposed perpetual
renewal of the pangs attending on the
last struggles of life with death, contrasted
with the inexorable scowl or malignant grin of
fiends methodizing torture: a horrid feature
reserved by Dante for the last pit of his Inferno,
and far beyond the culinary abominations
of Sandro Botticelli.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p><p>Though Luca's style of design was no more
that of Masaccio than Michael Agnolo's that of
Raphael, less characteristic than grand, and fit
to be the vehicle of those conceptions and attitudes
which furnished hints of imitation to
the painter of the Last Judgement in the Sistina,
yet he was master of a grace in celestial
scenery and angelic attitudes unapproached by
his contemporaries, seldom equalled and never
surpassed by his successors.</p>

<p>Luca Signorelli was a painter of much popularity.
Urbino, Volterra, Florence, Rome, his
native and many other towns, possess or possessed
works of his. He was related to the
family of the Vasari of Arezzo, and caressed
and encouraged to the art his infant biographer.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Another of the artists employed in the Sistina,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
inferior to Luca, but of no despicable
(though, if we look at Masaccio, too highly
rated) powers, was Domenico Bigordi, commonly
called Del Ghirlandajo;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> this is he
under whose auspices not only his son Ridolfo,
but even Bonaroti and the best artists of the
succeeding epoch, began their course. Precision
of outline, decorum of countenance, variety
of ideas, facility and diligence, distinguish his
works. He is the first of Florentines, who
gave depth and keeping to composition: if
gold and tinsel glitter are not entirely banished
from his colours, they appear at least less often.
He was fond of introducing portraits among
his actors, but with selection and of distinguished
characters; though hands and feet
had no part in his attention to physiognomy.
The churches Degli Innocenti, Santa Trinit&agrave;,
and S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria Novella at Florence, possess his
most celebrated productions, and many are
scattered over Tuscany and the Ecclesiastic
State. Of the two which he painted in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Sistina, the Resurrection of Christ perished;
the Vocation of Peter and Andrew to the
Apostolate Survives.</p>

<p>Cosimo Rosselli and Pier di Cosimo likewise
employed at the Sistina, inferior in all
essential parts to their competitors, owe the
perpetuity of their names less to their parti-coloured
glare and immoderate display of gold and
azure, which attracted the vulgar eye of their
employer the Pope, than to the luck of having
been the masters of Bartolomeo della Porta,
and Andrea del Sarto.</p>

<p>Piero and Antonio Pollajuoli, though employed
only as statuaries in the same Chapel, possessed
no inconsiderable powers as painters. Piero's
pictures at S. Miniato discover the scholar of
Castagno, austere countenances and deep and
massy colour; but in novelty of composition
and design he yields to his brother and pupil
Antonio, whose Martyrdom of St. Sebastian
in the Chapel Pucci of that church, though
humble in style, crude in colour, and oddly
rather than originally conceived, has been numbered
with the first productions of the age,
because with the earliest traces of legitimate
anatomy it exhibits its application, and subordinates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
enumeration to function. Both the
Pollajuoli died at Rome.</p>

<p>Don Bartolomeo of Arezzo, having nothing
to add of his own to the works of the Sistina,
is mentioned here only as the helper of Luca
Signorelli and Pietro Perugino; nor is Filippino
Lippi, the natural son of Fr&agrave; Filippo,
numbered among the companions of Sandro his
master, though the perpetual recurrence of antique
customs and dresses in his works makes it
probable that he formed his juvenile studies at
Rome. Inferior in real capacity to his father,
he may be praised rather for the accessory
than the substantial parts of his works: he
filled with an unequal hand the remaining
panels left by Masaccio al Carmine; and in the
Minerva at Rome, yields the palm in expression
and amenity of ideas to his own scholar
Raffaelino del Garbo, whose early works at
Monte Oliveto of Florence, and elsewhere, give
sufficient evidence that he might have raised
himself to the first artists of his day, had not
the cravings of a numerous family crushed his
powers, and poverty and dejection hastened his
death. His contemporary Andrea Verocchio,
though a celebrated statuary, and a designer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
style, has deserved our notice as a painter,
only because he was the master of Lionardo da
Vinci, the first name in the annals of Tuscany's
golden epoch.</p>

<p>Vinci, a burgh of Lower Valdarno, had the
honour of giving a surname to Lionardo, the
natural son<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> of one Ser Piero, a state notary at
Florence. Elevated by nature above the common
standard of men, born to discover, he
joined to boundless inquiry intrepidity of pursuit,
and lofty conception to minute investigation,
nor only in the arts connected with his
own, music and poesy, but in science, philosophy,
mathematics, mechanics, hydrostatics: this
wide mental range, supported by equal vigour
and gracefulness of body, was commended by
every accomplishment of a gentleman. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
was the genius whom Nature had destined to
establish art on elements, to open the realms of
light and shade, to inspire the subject with its
tone, and to poise expression between insipidity
and caricature.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the distractions of so many
diverging inclinations, for powers they could
not yet be called, an innate attachment to the
art appears to have predominated at the earliest
period to such a degree that Ser Piero determined
to place Lionardo under his friend
Verocchio, whom he soon excelled in painting,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
and in modelling equalled.</p>

<p class="p2b">The obscurity which involves the life of
Lionardo from his boyish years, through the
bloom of youth, to the vigour of manhood, can
only be accounted for by that independence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
mind which made him prefer indulgence of his
own various inclinations to a decided, steady,
and if more confined, more lucrative pursuit of
art. By what means he, whom Vasari describes
as possessing "nothing,"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> was enabled to gratify
studies and fancies equally expensive, no where
appears; it appears not that he was patronized
by the great and rich; he escaped the eye of
the Medici;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> it was reserved for Lodovico
Sforza to discover and to conduct the first citizen
of Florence to Milano, and for aught we
are told, rather from expectation of amusement
than motives of homage. Lodovico was a dilettante
in music, and wished to increase the
harmony of his concerts with the silver tones of
the lyre, invented and constructed by Lionardo,
who, we are told, soon distanced all rival
performers, and by the aid of his powers as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Improvisatore</span>," became the object of general
admiration: it was then, and perhaps not till
then, that the Duke cast a steadier eye on his
superior accomplishments, and allowed the musician
to become a benefactor to the public in
adopting his plans for the establishment and
direction of an academy; and granting the
means for carrying into effect the still more important
ones of conducting the Adda to Milano,
and a navigable canal from Martisana to
Chiavenna, and the Valteline, &amp;c. plans and
effects only interrupted by the fall of the
Sforzas and the captivity of Lodovico.</p>

prove that Verocchio's real talent was sculpture: but the
models of the three statues cast in bronze, by Rustici, for

<p class="lecture"><br />THE SCHOOL OF FLORENCE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">We</span> are now arrived at the epoch which
forms the distinctive character of the Tuscan
school, the epoch of Michael Agnolo. In
placing him here, chronology has been less attended
to than the spirit of works; for Fr&agrave; Bartolomeo,
Andrea del Sarto, and others, his contemporaries
or juniors, belong more properly to
the period of Lionardo than his; the elements
of which he gave in the Cartoon of Pisa, and
the consummation in the Capella Sistina, on
which his school and the imitation of his style
were founded; and to which the politics of his
time, the splendid oligarchy of the Medici, and
the fierce republican spirit of their opponents,
gave an energy and produced efforts, unknown
to society in repose.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the insinuating arts by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
which the Medici had debauched public affection,
and that undermining power which at last
changed influence to tyranny, they were in
less than a century<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> three times exiled from
their country. The first, the banishment of
Cosmo, called the Father of his Country, lasted
not above one year, and drew no consequences;
for the interval between it and the next (1494)
was marked with uniform success, and its last
twenty years<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> with the splendid administration
and the extended patronage of Lorenzo the
Magnificent. His Garden near the church of
S. Marco, which he opened as a repository and
a school of art, has been little less celebrated
than the Hesperian ones of old: it contained,
if not all that had been discovered, what could
be purchased of antique statues, basso-relievoes,
and fragments of every kind; and the apartments
were hung with pictures, cartoons, and
designs of Donatello, Brunellesco, Paolo Uccello.
Fr&agrave; Giovanni da Fiesole, Masaccio, &amp;c.;
here the student was not only instructed, but,
by the magnificence of the founder, supported;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and it may without exaggeration be asserted,
that whatever rose to eminence in the art at
that period, was the offspring of Lorenzo's
garden.</p>

<p>His death was followed by the expulsion of
his sons, Pietro, Giovanni, afterwards Leo X.,
and Julian, in the sequel Duke of Nemours.
An immediate anarchy succeeded the expulsion;
the populace broke into their houses,
destroyed or carried off their furniture, and demolished
the residence of Giovanni, the garden
of Lorenzo, and the palace on the Via Larga,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
at once. The numerous partisans of the family,
however, contrived to save much.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Other circumstances conspired to render this
interval of anarchy pernicious to art, till the return
of the Medici in 1512. Towards the close
of the fifteenth century, the Dominican Fr&agrave; Girolamo
Savonarola, of enthusiastic memory, by
prophecies and sermons, loaded with democratic
principles, gained gradually such an ascendancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
over the minds of the people, that the
Signoria found themselves forced to adopt a
senate at large; in other words, to submit to a
democracy. But Savonarola, not content with
political victory, aimed at a total revolution in
morals, and continued to lash the profligacy
of public manners, overflowing in voluptuous
song and music, or gazing at the lascivious nudities
of statues and pictures, as irresistible incentives
to vice. It had been customary during
carnival, to erect certain cabins in the market-place,
to set them on fire on the eve of Ash-Wednesday,
and bid them farewell amid the
shouts of convivial mirth and the frolic of amorous
dalliance. Savonarola instituted in 1497 a
public festival of another kind: a large scaffold
was erected in the market-place, a vast number
of the finest specimens in painting and sculpture,
offensive from their nudities, were collected;
the pictures placed on the first step; the
sculptures, especially when portraits of first-rate
Florentine belles, disposed on the second; the
whole inclosed by foreign precious tapestry, and
that, with great solemnity, set on fire. The
scaffolding of the next year excelled the first in
magnificence; its gorgeous apparel invested the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
busts of the most celebrated beauties of former
years; those of the Bencina, Lena Morella, Bina
and Maria de'Lenzi, works of the most eminent
sculptors; on it was placed a copy of Petrarca,
decorated with gold, missal-painting, and miniatures,
estimated at fifty <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">scudi d'oro</span>; and to prevent
theft, the whole was constantly guarded.
The procession approached, surrounded the scaffold,
and amid a concert of consecrating hymns,
bells, trumpets, cymbals, and the acclamations
of the Signoria and the people, the victims,
sprinkled with holy water, were delivered to
flame by the torches of the guards.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Such was
the epidemic influence of this enthusiasm, that
even artists, the gentle Fr&agrave; Bartolomeo, Lorenzo
di Credi, and many more caught the infection,
and contributed to the sacrifice, till the
death of Savonarola and the return of the Medici
extinguished the furor.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The democracy, however, gave origin to two
works, which not only atoned for the ravages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
it had committed, but whose splendour no subsequent
&aelig;ra of art has been able to eclipse, or
perhaps to equal: the two Cartoons of Lionardo
da Vinci and M. Angelo Buonarroti, destined to
decorate the senatorial hall, by order of Pietro
Soderini. They produced an immediate revolution
in art, but disappeared like meteors in the
tumult that attended the reinstatement of the
Medici and the fall of the Gonfaloniere, 1512.</p>

<p class="p2b">The third expulsion of the Medici&mdash;Hippolyto
and Alessandro, the sons of Giuliano the
Magnificent, and all their relatives&mdash;was the
consequence of the sack of Rome, 1527, and
the Pontificate of Clemente VII. The Medici,
pressed by the moment, consigned part of
their technic treasure, their bronzes, cameos,
&amp;c. to the care of their client Baccio Bandinelli.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
During the havoc, Michael Angelo's
statue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> of David lost an arm,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and the waxen
figures of Leo X. and Clemente VII. in the
church of the "Annunciata," were mutilated
and carried off; and perhaps much more
was lost in the demolition of the suburbs,
which took place to secure the town itself
against the siege of 1529. But active resistance
and lampoons proved equally ineffectual; the
destiny of the Medici prevailed, and Florence
paid ducal homage in 1530 to Alessandro;
whose assassination, indeed, by Lorenzo his relative,
commonly called Lorenzino, produced,
six years afterwards, another sedition and farther
damage to their stores of art by the soldiers,
who, at the instigation of Alessandro
Vitelli, broke into and plundered both their
houses. Cosmo the First succeeded Alessandro,
and left uninterrupted dominion to his heirs:
but if the consolidation of monarchy prevented
the momentary devastations of insurrection, it
failed to re-produce the splendid period that
flashed athwart the storms of democracy.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<h4>MICHAEL ANGELO BUONARROTI.</h4>

<h4>1474&mdash;1564.</h4>

<p class="p2">M. Angelo was born at Castel Caprese, and
showed such early proofs of a decided attachment
to art, that he was put into the school of
Domenico del Ghirlandaio. Here he soon advanced
beyond the principles of the master,
who, jealous of a rival in his pupil, recommended
him to Lorenzo de Medici, for admission
among the students of sculpture in his
garden; where, under the tuition of Bertoldo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
an ancient scholar of Donatello, he soon mastered
the elements, and, equally conspicuous for
his superiority and diligence, attracted the attention
and gained the patronage of Lorenzo,
but excited the envy of his fellow-students, one
of whom, Torrigiano, on some slight provocation,
with a blow of the fist shattered his nose,
which left him with a mark for life.</p>

<p>That predilection for sculpture imbibed from
his earliest days and now invigorated by the
incessant study of the antique with practice,
the successful specimens mentioned in copies
and productions of his own,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> leave little authority
to the tradition that he studied much after
Masaccio.</p>

<p>His mind appears to have anticipated the expulsion
of the Medici, and he left Florence for
Bologna, where he found a protector in Aldrovandi,
for whom he executed two small statues,
of an Angel and of a St. Petronius on the tomb
of S. Dominico. After his return to Florence
he continued to work in sculpture, and a legend,
less probable than amusing, of an Amor sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
for an antique to Cardinal Riario, has been
fondly repeated by his biographers. He now
went to Rome and produced two of his most
surprising works&mdash;the Bacchus of the Museo
Fiorentino, and the Madonna della Piet&agrave; in
one of the chapels of the Basilica of S. Pietro.
On his return to Florence, Pietro Soderini
tried his powers on a huge block of marble,
mutilated by the ignorance of one Maestro
Simone: he contrived to rear from it the
statue of David, which, in 1504, was placed,
and still remains in front of the old palace.
These works, not less discriminated by peculiarity
of character, than connected by propriety
of style and energy of finish, were produced
within the short period of six years, and equally
prove the wide range of his powers, and the
perseverance of his application to sculpture.</p>

<p>What he did as painter, during, or soon
after this period, is for us reduced to the single
specimen which he executed for Angelo Doni;
for the far-famed Cartoon of Pisa, of which we
soon shall have occasion to speak, begun in
contest with Lionardo da Vinci, but not finished
till after his second return from Rome,
perished, as a whole, long before the middle
of the sixteenth century.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after his election to the Pontificate, Giulio
II. smitten with the wish of a sepulchral monument,
called M. Angelo to Rome for that purpose.
His first plan was to make it colossal, and
on all sides detached, but the obstacles which
were thrown in its way for a number of years,
reduced it at length to the form in which it now
appears at S. Pietro in Vincoli, with probably
one figure only by M. Angelo's own hand,
the celebrated statue of Moses in front. The
attachment of Giulio to M. Angelo was great,
but the independent spirit of the artist greater.
Indignant at being refused access once to the
Pontiff, whose mind was worried by the disturbances
at Bologna, he fled, and though pursued
by five messengers with letters pressing
him to come back, obstinately went on to Florence;
nor could his three breves<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to the Signoria, draw him from his asylum;
till Pier Soderini guaranteed his safety by investing
him with the title of envoy from the
Republic. Thus equipped, and accompanied by
Cardinal Soderini, brother to the Gonfaloniere,
he set out for Bologna, was reconciled to the
Pope, and made his statue in bronze. It was
placed over the gate of S. Petronio, but
was thrown down in 1511 by the party of the
Bentivogli, and, with the exception of the
head, said to have been preserved by Duke
Alfonso of Ferrara, converted into a piece of
heavy artillery.</p>

<p>Scarcely returned to Rome, M. Angelo, by
command of Giulio, instigated as it is supposed
by Bramante and Giuliano da Sangallo, found
himself forced to try his powers on a novel
theatre of art, the decoration of the ceiling
and lunette of the Capella Sistina. Whatever
were the motives of the two architects, whether
private pique, or envy of M. Angelo's influence
over the Pontiff, or friendship for Raffaello,
and the desire of showing his superiority
over one whom they deemed a novice in fresco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
they deserved the thanks of their own and
every succeeding epoch, for the most eminent
service ever rendered to art. Vasari owns that
M. Angelo, conscious of his want of practice,
endeavoured to escape from the commission,
and even proposed Raffaello as fitter for the
task; but his powers soon supplied what circumstances
had refused, and single conquered
with every obstacle Time itself; for, nearly
fabulous to relate, the whole, though interrupted
more than once by the Pontiff's impatience,
was sufficiently finished to be exhibited
to the public in one year and ten
months.</p>

<p>This task finished, M. Angelo, eager to resume
his labours on the monument, was disappointed
by the sudden death of Giulio, (1513,)
and the election of Leo X. produced a total
change in his situation; he was ordered to Florence
to construct the front of the Laurentian
Library.</p>

<p>Though the death of Leo, or rather the accession
of Adrian VI. had paralysed art, Michael
Angelo employed the dull interim by adding
some statues to the monument of Giulio;
till, in 1523, Clemente VII. reappointed him
to the superintendence of the new sacristy and
library of S. Lorenzo. It was about this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
time that he finished and sent to Rome the
statue of Christ, still placed in the Minerva.</p>

<p>The arts received a new shock from the sack
of Rome, 1527, and the expulsion of the Medici
from Florence, at which crisis the Signoria conferred
on Michael Angelo, who was a warm
Republican,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the superintendence of the fortifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and the defence of Monte Miniato,
on which the safety of the city depended.
Meanwhile what time he could save from his
public trust, he secretly<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> employed to finish or
advance the symbolic and monumental statues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of S. Lorenzo, and from the cartoon to paint
in distemper a Leda for the Duke of Ferrara.
Finding, however, that no defence could save
the city, he saved himself by the secret paths
of S. Miniato, and escaped to Venice, 1529;
from whence he only returned to find the dominion
of the Medici once more established,
himself pardoned, again employed by Clemente
at S. Lorenzo, and soon after sent for to Rome
on a plan of painting two central frescoes,
the Last Judgement and the Fall of Lucifer,
for the Sistine Chapel,&mdash;long favourite ideas of
the artist,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> but with the works at Florence for
that time checked by the death of Clemente,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
1534. He now with redoubled ardour applied
to the monument of Giulio, urged by his
devotion to the house of De Rovere, the considerable
pecuniary advance he had received, and
the threats of the executors and the Duke of
Urbino; but the accession of Paul III. again
frustrated his exertions: the Pontiff resolved
to have the exclusive boast of powers he had so
long admired, interposed his authority, and
obliged the executors and agents of the Duke
to give up the original circumambient plan,
and content themselves with the storied front
which exists now.</p>

<p>This adjusted, Michael Angelo immediately
proceeded to comply with the wishes of the
Pope: if Paolo was inferior to Giulio in impetuosity,
he was his equal in fervour of attachment
to art, and excelled him, if not every
other name which patronage has distinguished,
in personal respect and public homage to the
artist. No work ever received countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and honours equal to those conferred on the
Last Judgement of Michael Angelo, from its
plan to its ultimate finish by Paolo Farnese.
His first visit to the artist was attended by a
train of ten cardinals:<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> though ambitious to
have the work consecrated to his own name,
in deference to Michael Angelo's attachment
to the memory of Giulio, he submitted to his
refusal of displacing the arms of De Rovere at
the top of the picture, in favour of the Farnesian.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Induced by the specious sophistry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Sebastian del Piombo to prefer oil to fresco in
the execution of the work, he permitted the
wall to be prepared for that purpose, but on
Michael Angelo's declaring oil painting an
art for women only and sedentary tameness,
he yielded to the decision, and patiently saw the
whole apparatus dashed to the ground. When,
before its final disclosure to the public, he took
a private view of the whole composition at the
Chapel, less convinced than irritated by the
bigoted philippic of an attendant prelate
against the daring display of immodest nudity,
he acquiesced in the artist's well-known
revenge, and refused to revoke or mitigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the punishment inflicted on the unlucky
critic.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The first conception of the Last Judgement,
which completes the plan originally laid down
for the decoration of the Chapel, notwithstanding
the obstacles which protracted the execution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
must find its date in the Pontificate
of Giulio, from the Cartoons probably begun
under Clemente. M. Angelo proceeded to the
fresco itself at an early period, if not immediately
after the accession of Paolo, 1534, and
finished it in 1541, or perhaps 1542; for both
these years are mentioned by Vasari; who, if
not present at the removal of the scaffolding,
attended its immediate display to the public.
The completion of this 'multitudinous' work,
M. Angelo, at an age of 68, or somewhat beyond,
might justly consider as the consummation of
his public career in painting: but the Pontiff,
still ambitious to possess exclusive specimens
of his powers in a fabric built by his own orders
and consecrated to his own name, obliged him
to continue his labours in two huge frescoes of
the Capella Paolina, representing the Conversion
of St. Paul and the Crucifixion of St. Peter.
The lassitude inseparable from the waste of so
much energy on the Last Judgement, the mental
and bodily fatigue attendant on the arrangement
and execution of new plans, if less enormous
less congenial, protracted their ultimate
completion to his 75th year, proved them
children of necessity rather than choice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
confirmed the truth of his observation to Vasari,
that painting in fresco, the union of powers
required for a great public work, is not an art
of old age.</p>

<p>And here indeed terminates the career of the
Painter; the remainder of his life was divided
between architecture and sculpture. This,
which had always been his favourite pursuit, was
now become the darling companion of his private
hours, the amusement of his solitude, and
the preservative of his health&mdash;for this purpose
he furnished his study with a colossal block, destined
for the complicated group of a Piet&agrave;: but
though age had neither tamed his conception nor
palsied his hand,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> it checked his perseverance;
he no longer struggled to subdue the flaws of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
materials or to give them the air of beauties;
he dismissed the group unfinished, and continued
to exercise himself on another of inferior
size.</p>

<p>The death of Antonio da S. Gallo, 1546,
put it in the power of Paolo to create M.
Angelo architect of S. Pietro, a trust of which
he acquitted himself with a superiority which
baffled all the opposition of venality and envy.
He was probably, from Ictinus to our time, the
first and the last of architects who refused
salary and emolument, and consecrated his labours
to divine love. Some of his successors,
perhaps, might insinuate that he indemnified
himself with being at the same time architect
of the Campidoglio and the Farnese Palace.</p>

<p>After the demise of Paolo, Cosmo I. Duke
of Florence, by means of Vasari, earnestly intreated
him to pass the remainder of his life at
Florence; but the infirmities of age, and still
more, inward grief for the subversion of the republic,
with indignation at the established usurpation
of the Medici, rendered these intreaties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
ineffectual. Equally unshaken by them and the
vile rumour of his dotage, spread by the venal
gang of Pirrho Ligorio, after crowning the Basilica
with its cupola, he steered through calm
and tempest on to his ninetieth year, the last of
his life, 1564, and was buried in S. Apostoli;
but, by the orders of Cosmo, secretly conveyed
to Florence, where the pomp of academical
exequies, the starched eloquence of Varchi, and
a monument in Santa Croce from a design of
Vasari, awaited his remains.</p>

<p>It is difficult to decide who understood
Michael Angelo less, his admirers or his censors;
though both rightly agree in placing him
at the head of an epoch; those of the re-establishment,
these of the perversion, of style.</p>

<p>All extremes touch each other: languid
praise and frigid censure belong to the paths
of mediocrity, but he who enlarges the circle
of knowledge, passes from the realm of
talents to that of genius, leaps on an undiscovered
or long-lost shore, and stamps it with
his name, commands indiscriminate homage,
and provokes irreconcilable censure. He who
reflects on the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pi&ugrave; che Uman, Angelo divino</span>"
of Ariosto, the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">via terribile</span>" of Agostino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Carracci, and for centuries on the general
homage of a nation allowed to legislate
in art, will not be easily persuaded that these
epithets, this prerogative, were granted to an
artist merely for correctness of design or anatomic
discrimination, or that he exclusively
obtained them for uniting sculpture, painting,
and architecture in himself; three branches
of one stem, and diverging only in mechanism
and application, they have been more
than once eminently united by others, and
were seldom altogether separated before the
time of Carlo Maratta. And yet this is all
on which the eminence of Michael Angelo
has been hitherto supposed to rest, all that can
be gathered from the astrologic nonsense and
the Tuscan loquacity of his blind adorer, Vasari&mdash;and
what he found not, it would be time
idly lost to search for in his contemporaries and
successors, down to Reynolds, who, though
chiefly smitten with the breadth of Michael
Angelo, knew him better than all the copyists
of his school.</p>

<p>The art preceded Michael Angelo as a craft;
more or less practice alone distinguishes Pietro
Perugino from Cimabue: whilst copy and imitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
remain synonymes, there can be no
choice in art; instead of the real nature it
will copy the accidents of objects, and substitute
the model for the man.</p>

<p>Michael Angelo appeared and soon felt that
the candidate of legitimate fame is to build his
works, not on the imbecile forms of a degenerate
race, disorganized by clime, country, education,
laws, and society; not on the transient
refinements of fashion or local sentiment, unintelligible
beyond their circle and century to
the rest of mankind; but to graft them on
Nature's everlasting forms and those general
feelings of humanity, which no time can efface,
no mode of society obliterate;&mdash;and in consequence
of these reflections discovered the epic
part of painting: that basis, that indestructibility
of forms and thoughts, that simplicity of
machinery on which Homer defied the ravages
of time, which sooner or later must sweep
to oblivion every work propped by baser materials
and factitious refinements.</p>

<p>The subject of the Sistine Chapel is Theocracy
and Religion, the Origin and the first
Duty of Man. All minute discrimination of
character is alien to the primeval simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the moment&mdash;God and Man alone appear.
The veil of Eternity is rent; Time, Space,
and Matter teem; life darts from God, and
adoration from the creature; deviation from
this principle is the origin of Evil; the economy
of Justice and Grace commences; Prophets
and Sibyls in awful synod are the heralds
of the Redeemer, and the host of patriarchs
the pedigree of the Son of Man. The brazen
Serpent and the fall of Haman, the Giant subdued
by the Stripling, and the Conqueror destroyed
by female weakness, are types of His
mysterious progress, till Jonah pronounces Him
immortal, and the magnificence of the Last
Judgement sums up the whole and re-unites
the Founder and the race.</p>

<p>Michael Angelo, in his Last Judgement,
with a few exceptions, has wound up the life
of man, considered as the subject of religion,
faithful or rebellious; and in a generic manner
has distributed happiness and misery.</p>

<p>The more finished a character, the more, discriminated
by his actions and turn of thought
from his contemporaries, he pursues paths of
his own, so much the more he attracts, so much
the more he repels; the ardour of the one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
equal to the violence of the other: he is not
merely disliked, he is detested by all who have
no sense for him; whilst by those who enter his
train of thought, or sympathise with him, he is
adored. Indifference has no share in what
relates to him, it is a softer word for antipathy&mdash;it
resembles the indifference of a female wooed;
her indifference, her apathy, is a refusal without
a verbal repulse. Where yes or no must decide,
the mouth that can form neither, rejects.
The principles, the style of Michael Angelo,
are of that so closely-connected magnitude,
that they are either all true or all false: pretended
gold is either gold or not&mdash;the purer,
the simpler a substance, the less it can coalesce
with another; a pretended diamond of the
size of a fist, is either of inestimable value or
of none. If Michael Angelo did not establish
art on a solid basis, he subverted it; he can
claim only the heresies of paradox and receive
their reward&mdash;disgust.</p>

<p>What Armenini relates as a proof of his
nearly intuitive power of conception and execution,
may be repeated as a much stronger
instance of his deference and gratitude for the
most humble claims. "Meeting one day, behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
S. Pietro, with a young Ferrarese, a potter who
had baked some model of his, M. Angelo thanked
him for his care, and in return offered him
any service in his power: the young man, emboldened
by his condescension, fetched a sheet of
paper, and requested him to draw the figure of a
standing Hercules: M. Angelo took the paper,
and retiring to a small shed near by, put his
right foot on a bench, and with his elbow on
the raised knee and his face on his hand stood
meditating a little while, then began to draw
the figure, and having finished it in a short
time, beckoned to the youth, who stood waiting
at a small distance, to approach, gave it him,
and went away toward Belvedere. That design,
as far as I was then able to judge, in precision
of outline, shadow, and finish, no miniature
could excel; it afforded matter of astonishment
to see accomplished in a few minutes what
might have been reasonably supposed to have
taken up the labour of a month."</p>

<p>After the demise of Raffaello, legislation in
Art was no longer disputed with M. Angelo;
he not only became the oracle of youth, but appears
to have inherited all the popularity of his
great rival. A signal, though little known proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of this, is told by Bellori, in the Life of Federigo
Barrocci, who, he says, used to tell, that when,
drawing one day in company with Taddeo Zuccari
a frieze of Polidoro, Michael Angelo, as
usual, passed by on his little mule on his way
to the palace, all the youths rose and ran to
meet him with their drawings in their hands;
Federigo alone remained bashfully behind in
his place, which when Taddeo saw, he took his
little portfolio to Michael Angelo, who attentively
examined the designs, among which was
a careful copy of his Moses; he praised it, and
desiring to see the lad who had drawn that
figure, animated him to pursue the method of
study which he had begun.</p>

<p>The deference which he paid to the unassuming
and the humble, he amply redeemed by the
full assumption of his rights, and conscious assertion
of superiority, when provoked to the contest
by those who considered themselves as his
equals, entered into competition with him, or attempted
to share in his labours. Thus he repaid
the sarcasms of Pietro Perugino, by calling him
publicly a dunce in art; and when Pietro smarting,
impatient of the ridicule, summoned him
to the Tribunal of the Eight, he made good his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
charge, and saw him dismissed with contempt.
Thus he rejected all partnership with Jacopo
Sansovino, in the execution of the Facciata of
San Lorenzo at Florence, though Leone X.
appears to have intended it, by sending both
together to Pietra Santa to provide the marbles
necessary for that purpose, and examining
both their models.</p>

<p>When Paolo III. had resolved on the fortifications
of the Borgo, and, in order to ascertain the
best mode of doing it, had assembled many persons
of rank, with Antonio da Sangallo, Michael
Angelo, as architect of the fortifications of S.
Miniato at Florence, was likewise invited to join
the assembly, and, after much contest, his opinion
asked; he freely told it, though contrary to
that of Sangallo and others present; and when
the architect bade him to be content with the
prerogatives of sculpture and painting without
pretending to skill in fortification, he replied,
that of the former two he knew little, but that
of fortification, considering the time his mind
had dwelt on it, and the proofs he had given of
the solidity of his theory, he did not hesitate to
claim more knowledge than what came to the
share of Sangallo and all his relatives; and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
proceeded, in the presence of all, to point out
the many errors which Antonio had committed.</p>

<p>Another instance of a still greater independence
of mind, Vasari<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> has recorded in the peremptory
answer which M. Angelo gave to the
Committee of Cardinals, &amp;c. instigated by the
partisans of Sangallo, (La Setta Sangallesca,
Vasari,) to inspect the process of the fabric
of S. Pietro, and to examine his plan. Ignorant
of his design to derive the main light
of the edifice from the cupola, they found
fault with the scanty distribution of light, and
told the Pontiff that M. Angelo had spoiled
S. Pietro, and instead of a luminous temple,
was erecting a gloomy vault. Giulio having
communicated this to him at a general meeting
of the deputies and inspectors, M. Angelo
replied, I wish to hear these deputies talk
myself: "Here we are," answered Cardinal
Marcello&mdash;"Then know, Monsignore," said
he, "that over these windows, in the vault
which is to be raised, there are to be placed
three more."&mdash;"You never told us this before!"
said Cervino.&mdash;"No," replied M. Angelo, "I am
not, nor ever will be bound to tell your Eminence,
or any other person, what I must or
what I mean to do: your duty is to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
money and take care that it be not stolen;
what belongs to the plan and execution of the
building you are to leave to me." Then turning
to the Pope, "Holy Father," continued he, "you
see what I gain; the fatigue I undergo is time
and labour lost, unless my soul gain by it."
The Pope, who loved him, and rejoiced at the
defeat of the cabal, laying hands on his shoulders,
said, "Doubt not your soul and body shall
be equal gainers by it."</p>

<p>Among the many expectations in which he
was disappointed, that which he appears to have
formed on the early talent of Jacopo Carucci, as it
was the most sanguine, must have been the most
distressing; for, on seeing his figures of Faith
and Charity with attendant Infants, in fresco,
at the Nunziata, and considering them as produced
by a youth of nineteen, he said, in the
words of Vasari, "This young man, from what
appears, grant life and pursuit, will raise this
art to heaven."</p>

<p>But Jacopo did neither long pursue the same
principles nor adopt superior ones: infected,
like Andrea del Sarto, by the temporary fever
which the style of Albert Durer had spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
over Florence. He was, however, the favourite
copyist in oil of M. Angelo's Cartoons, and
as such, in preference, recommended by him to
Alfonso D'Avalo, Marchese del Guasto, and
Bartolomeo Bettini, his friend, who had obtained
cartoons, the former of a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Noli-me-tangere</span>;
this of a naked Venus caressed by Cupid.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>The name of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuliano Bugiardini</span>, supported
only by its own feeble powers, would probably
long have sunk to oblivion, had it not been
kept afloat by the personal attachment of M.
Angelo. In Vasari, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giuliano</span> is the synonyme,
of helpless impotence; he had certainly neither
the dexterity nor the grasp of the Aretine biographer;
but he also had neither the pretension
nor the craft. There is, and chiefly among
artists, a singular class of men, who, with great
moral simplicity, but a capacity less than moderate,
court with ungovernable passion an art
which they are doomed never to possess, but to
whom self-complacency compensates for every
disappointment of the most ungrateful perseverance,
public neglect and private irrision:
they neither envy nor suspect, and though not
intimidated by a superiority which they do
not fully comprehend, are ready to respect the
part that comes within their compass. Such a
man was Bugiardini; and such a character M.
Angelo was likely to appreciate;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and though
aware that he was not equal to serious communication
in art, to select him as a companion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
his leisure, and to assist or submit to him, as the
simplicity of his character required;&mdash;of either
we shall select from Vasari an instance. When
he was occupied with the picture of S<sup>ta</sup>. Catherina,
for the Church of S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria Novella,
he requested the advice of M. Angelo on the
arrangement of a file of soldiers which he
meant to place on the foreground, flying, fallen,
wounded, killed; because the idea of their
having formed a file, could not be expressed
within the scanty space he had allotted them,
without having recourse to fore-shortenings,
which he confessed to be beyond his power.
M. Angelo, to please him, took a coal, and
with his own comprehension drew on the panel
a file of naked figures, variously fore-shortened,
falling different ways, forwards, backwards,
with others dead or wounded: but the
whole being merely in outlines, left Giuliano
still at a loss. Tribolo, therefore, to draw him
from this dilemma, undertook to form them in
clay, leaving the surface of each figure rough,
to increase more forcibly the chiaroscuro: this
method, however, so little pleased the neatness
of Giuliano, that the moment Tribolo left
him, he with a wet pencil licked them into a
polish, which took away grain and effect together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and when the picture was finished, left
no trace of M. Angelo's ever having seen it.</p>

<p>Messer Ottaviano de' Medici had requested
Giuliano to paint him a portrait of M. Angelo.
He obtained the consent of M. Angelo: having
held him between chat and work two hours at
the first sitting&mdash;for M. Angelo delighted to
hear him talk&mdash;Giuliano got up, and said, "M.
Angelo, if you want to see yourself, rise: I
have settled the character of the face." M. Angelo
rose, looked at the portrait, and said,
smiling, "What the devil (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">che diavolo</span>) have you
been doing? you have clapt one of the eyes
into one of the temples&mdash;look to it." Giuliano
having for some time looked silently at the
portrait, and the sitter, resolutely replied, "I do
not see what you said; but take your place, and
I'll give another glance at nature." M. Angelo,
who knew where the defect lay, sat down again
sneering; and Giuliano, having eyed repeatedly
now the picture and now M. Angelo, at last
rose and said, "It appears to me that the
thing is as I have drawn it, and that nature
shows it so." "Oh, then it is a defect of nature!"
replied Michael Angelo, "go on and
prosper in your work."</p>

<p class="p2b">Francesco Granacci, the companion of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
early studies, and Jacopo, called L'Indaco, the
enlivener of his solitude, enjoyed the same degree
of his familiarity; but as the real basis
of friendship is equality, and mutual esteem
founded on similarity of character and powers,
attachments merely formed by early habits or
congenial humour between men too dissimilar
else to admit of comparison, never can aspire
to its privileges and name. Condescension is
not always delicate, and the indiscretions of
simplicity sooner or later provoke the pride,
contempt, and arrogance of superior powers.
Giuliano, Granacci, and L'Indaco, experienced
all three from Michael Angelo; they were
among his conscripts for assisting in the frescoes
of the Capella; but finding their pigmy
capacities unequal to his colossal style, he not
only, in lofty silence, destroyed what they
had begun, but barring all access to the Chapel
and himself, forced them to return, vainly
grumbling, to Florence.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73_73" id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> There went a tale that Michael Angelo proposed to demolish
the palace of the Medicis, like that of the Bentivogli
at Bologna, and to call the site "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piazza de' Muli</span>," the place
of Bastards, in allusion to the illegitimacy of Clemente VII.
Alessandro, and others of that family. "A feature," says
Fiorillo, "if true, as characteristic of his natural ferocity
as disgraceful to his heart, after the benefits heaped on him
from his infancy by that family. Varchi, however, defends
him against this charge."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Whether this tale confutes itself
or not, may be left to the reader; but on an estimate of his
private and public conduct, as man and artist during the
long course of his life, it must be owned, that this is the period
which offers the most specious opportunity to a sceptic in
morals, of fixing some doubts on the integrity of his principles.
His earliest actions prove that he drew a severe line
between the duty which he owed to his country, and gratitude
imposed by private obligations. He left the family of
Pier de' Medici on finding his principles incompatible with
the laws of a free state; and on the expulsion of the petty
tyrants, without lending a hand to the devastation of their
property, felt it his duty to act as a free man on the re-establishment
of liberty, and to obey the laws of a state whose
right to legislate for itself had been acknowledged by all
Italy. It will not be said, that it is palliating duplicity to
assert, that as a private individual he had a right to accept
the behests of Leo X. and Clemente VII. for decorating a
sacred edifice; but when he became a leader of the revolution,
the trustee of his country's safety, the main defender of
the city, did he not more than degrade himself, by forgetting
the patriot in the artist, and "secretly" sacrificing time to raise
monuments to men whose titles he opposed and whose principles
he detested? Thus, whilst his conduct may prove the
absurdity of the tale, that he publicly, and with illiberal sarcasms,
advised the demolition of palaces belonging to a family
whose memory he secretly laboured to perpetuate in monuments
inspired by the most amorous phantasy; it certainly
does not screen his character from the imputation
of a duplicity to which no other period of his life offers a
parallel.</p></div>

altar-piece of the Last Judgement, no sketch that could give
an idea of the whole has yet been discovered; its place over
the grand door of the Chapel was reserved for the sacrilegious
'bravura' of the Neapolitan Matteo da Lecca, under the
pontificate of Gregorio XIII.: his composition, if impudence
of grouping deserve that name, must be supposed to bear
infinitely less analogy to the original conception of Michael
Angelo, than the tumultuary fresco of the Sicilian; who, says
Vasari, having lived many months with Michael Angelo as
a servant and colour-grinder, became possessed of some design
of his for that subject, and painted it in fresco in a
chapel of the Trinit&agrave; del Monte. Notwithstanding the incompetence
of the adventurer to manage such materials, the
naked groups showering from Heaven, and the hubbub of
transformed fiends grappling below in the abyss, struck the
beholder with terror and surprise;&mdash;a mass of Dantesque
images, and in Dantesque language described by the biographer.&mdash;V.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_77_77" id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> This pompous visit appears to have been made for the
purpose of inspecting the Cartoon; to remove the obstacles
to its completion which the unfinished state of the Giulian
monument still presented; and to convince the artist of the
value he set on the exclusive service of his genius. But, besides
the obligation of fulfilling his contract with the House
of De Rovere, Vasari seems to think that one principal reason
of Michael Angelo's tardiness to comply with the wishes of
the Pope, was the Pontiff's age, (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vedendolo tanto vecchio</span>,)
<i>i. e.</i> apprehension, if he lived long enough to prevent the
termination of the monument, of his dying too soon for the
completion of the fresco, and thus leaving him exposed to
the revenge of the Duke of Urbino: a conjecture not countenanced
by the Pontiff's age, who, at his accession, was
only eight years older than the artist.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> Bastiano, says Vasari, was a favourite of Michael Angelo,
but a disagreement took place between them about the
best method of painting the Last Judgement. Fr&agrave; Bastiano
had persuaded the Pontiff to give the preference to
oil, but Michael Angelo resolved to execute it only in fresco.
On seeing the Frate's preparation adopted, without agreeing
to it or opposing it, he remained inactive for several months;
till, on being pressed, he finally declared, that he would
either do it in fresco or not at all; that oil paint was a woman's
art, and the refuge of idlers at their ease like Fr&agrave; Bastiano.
In consequence of which, the Frate's incrustation
being dashed to the ground, and the wall duly prepared for
fresco, he set about the work, but never forgot the insult he
fancied to have received from the friar during life.&mdash;Vasari,
Vita di F.S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> Michael Angelo had finished more than three-fourths of
the work, when the Pontiff visited the Chapel, and on inspection,
turning to Messer Biagio, of Cesena, then master of
ceremonies, in his train, asked him what he thought of the
work? The scrupulous prelate replied, that so daring an
aggregate of shameless nudities in a sacred place was obscene
profanation, and an exhibition fitter for a tavern or a
brothel than a papal chapel. Michael Angelo, indignant,
and eager to revenge the affront, only waited for his departure,
and then, from memory, drew him in the character of
Dante's Minos, with a snake encircling his body and gnawing
his middle, in the midst of a hillock of fiends. In vain
did Messer Biagio supplicate the Pontiff and Michael Angelo
to take him out; he remained, and is there still. So far Vasari;
but tradition adds, that on Biagio's application, the
Pope asked in what part of the picture he was placed, and
being answered, in Hell, replied, had you been lodged in
Purgatory, you might perhaps have been dismissed, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sed ex
Inferno nulla est redemptio</span>." Condivi notices the story not
at all.
</p><p>
In the Diary of Paris de' Grassi, Messer Biagio is said to
have been appointed master of ceremonies by Leo X. 1518,
in the room of Nicola da Viterbo, and, if we believe Ducange,
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Table des Auteurs dans le Supplement du Glossaire</span>,)
he has written a diary himself.&mdash;See Fiorillo, i. p. 389.</p></div>

Callistratus, tells us, in his observations on the latter, page
855, that "he saw M. Angelo, at the age of sixty, strike
off more marble from a block in one quarter of an hour,
than four stonemasons usually did in three or four hours."
If this happened in 1550, as will appear from the following
passage, M. Angelo was then in his seventy-sixth

Christ appearing to Magdalen in the Garden, made every
exertion to have it executed in painting by Puntormo, as he
had been told by Michael Angelo that no one could serve
him better. Jacopo undertook the work, and succeeded to
a degree of excellence, which made Alessandro Vitelli, captain
of the Florentine guards, bespeak a second copy of him,
which he placed in his house at <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Civit&agrave; di Castello</span>."
</p>
<p>"Michael Angelo, to oblige his intimate friend Bartolomeo
Bettini, made him a Cartoon of Venus naked and Cupid
kissing her, to be executed by Puntormo in oil, for the
centre piece of an apartment, on the sides of which Bronzino
had begun to paint Dante, Petrarca, and Boccaccio, to be
followed by the rest of Tuscan love-songsters. The picture
of Puntormo was miraculous, but instead of being given to
Bettini for the price stipulated, was, by some favour-hunters,
his enemies, nearly extorted from Jacopo, and carried off as
a present to Duke Alessandro, returning the cartoon to
Bettini. A transaction which, when he heard it, irritated
Michael Angelo, who loved his friend, and made him dislike
Jacopo for it."&mdash;Vasari, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita di Jacopo da</span>, P.V.</p></div>

<p class="lecture">SCHOOL OF SIENA.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> the enumeration of Tuscan art, some
lovers of subdivision have fancied, with more
refinement than solidity, to discover in the
style of Sienese artists a characteristic sufficiently
distinct from the Florentine, to erect
Siena into a school. This characteristic, we
are told, is a peculiar gaiety in the selection
of colour, and an air of physiognomic vivacity
and serenity of face; both, it seems, the inheritance
of the Sienese race. They have, accordingly,
divided this school into three epochs:
the first is that of the <i>ancients</i> (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">gli antichi</span>);
and its first palpable patriarch, Guido, or Guidone,
commonly called <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Guido da Siena</i>, and noticed
already in the beginning of our chapter on
the Florentine school. He flourished before the
birth of Cimabue, in the first half of the thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
century, and is followed by the names
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ugolino da Siena</span> and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duccio</span> surnamed <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">di
Boninsegna</span>, the precursors of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Simone Memmi</span>,
the contemporary of Giotto, who painted Laura
and survives in the sonnets of her lover. Lippo
Memmi and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cecco da Martino</span>, his relatives,
float in the obscurity which prevailed till the
appearance of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ambrogio</span> and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pietro Lorenzetti</span>.
Of the first there still exists an extensive work
in the public palace, or rather a didactic poem,
which in suitable allegories and in varied
views, exhibits the vices of a bad government,
and personifies the qualities necessary to form
the rulers of a virtuous republic&mdash;a work
which, with less monotony of features, and
more judgment in the division of the subjects,
would, in the opinion of Lanzi, find little to
envy in the best-treated histories of Pisa's Campo
Santo. In partnership with his brother
Pietro, he painted, in the Hospital of Siena, the
Presentation and the Espousal of the Madonna&mdash;pictures
destroyed in 1720. This is that
Pietro who, in the Campo Santo of Pisa,
painted the Hermits of the Desert, and the
Terrors of Solitude invaded by an Infernal
Apparition, with a novelty of conception and a
richness of fancy, that render his work the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
most interesting of the whole series. That,
notwithstanding the plague, which had wasted
the population of Siena at that period, the art
continued to flourish, is proved by the numbers
who formed themselves into a civil body
under the immediate patronage of the Republic
itself. In some families it became an heirloom:
such were the Vanni and the Bartoli. Andrea di
Vanni, or more properly, di Giovanni, not only
figured as an artist in his native city, but was
delegated by the Republic to the Pope at Avignon,
and appears in the records as "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Capitano
del Popolo</span>;" and among the letters of Santa
Caterina da Siena, there are three addressed to
him.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Vasari has mentioned Taddeo di Bartolo,
(1351&mdash;1410.) whose works still exist
in the public palace and the adjoining hall.
They pretend to represent a number of celebrated
republicans, and chiefly Greeks and
Romans, but their physiognomies are all ideal,
and their dresses the costume of Siena. Something
was added to the monotony of these family
styles under the Pontificate of Pio II.
or Enea Silvio, (1503,) by Matteo di Giovanni,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in disposition, variety, expression, drapery; he
has accordingly been complimented by some
as the Masaccio of Siena, but remained unknown
to Vasari. The art gained still more
under the auspices of a second Piccolomini,
Pio III. (1503.) He employed Pinturicchio,
Raffaello, and other strangers, to perpetuate
the achievements of his predecessor Enea; and
they, Raffaello excepted, continued with Signorelli
and Genga to exercise their talents in
decorating the Palace of Pandolfo Petrucci,
who had usurped supreme power in the Republic.</p>

<p>The second period of Sienese art opens with
the sixteenth century, and the works of Giacomo
Pacchiarotto, or Pacchiarotti. They
resemble the produce of Perugino's school,
though distinguished by more vigour of composition.
But what entitles this epoch to the
claim of establishing the peculiar style of this
school, must be looked for in the works of
Giannantonio Razzi, Domenico Beccafumi, and
Baldassare Peruzzi.</p>

<p>Giannantonio Razzi,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> commonly called "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il
Soddoma</span>," is said by some to have been a native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
of Vergille, in the territory of Siena; by
others, of Vercelli, in Piedmont. Long residence,
however, supplied the want of birthright:
Siena claims him for her own; and if a
charming whole, suavity of tint combined with
force of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaroscuro</span>, be the principal characteristic
of that school, no native has expressed it
with equal evidence and felicity. This gaiety of
tone and manner some have traced to the jovial
turn of the man himself; as careless as gay, ever
in pursuit of youth and beauty, though with
an indiscretion that brands him with the stain
tacked to his name, from a character so volatile
and dissipated, that inequality of execution
might be expected which marks his happiest
effusions. Thus, in the Church of S. Domenico,
where he represented S<sup>ta</sup>. Caterina of Siena, on
receiving the stigmata, fainting in the arms of
two sister nuns, we forgive to the energy of
conception, the pathos of expression, and the
sympathy of tone that press the principal group
on our hearts, that neglect which left the figure
of the Saviour below mediocrity, and own, with
Baldassare Peruzzi, that we never saw mental
dereliction and fainting beauty expressed with
deeper sentiment and truth; a verdict which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
receives full sanction from him who relates it,
Vasari, less the biographer than the merciless
censor of the obnoxious Razzi, for whose moral
turpitude and technic slovenliness his sanctimonious
asperity found no other excuse than that
of madness, which swayed him to neglect or misapply
the powers of genius. Thus, in speaking
of the fresco at Monte Oliveto, in which Soddoma
had chosen to represent a bevy of harlots
let loose with song and dance on St.
Benedetto and his flock, to try their sanctity,
he reprobates the licentiousness that had
larded the subject with additional obscenity,
whilst he concludes by owning that it is one
of the best pictures in the Convent. How are
we to reconcile the neglect which, disdaining
to consult Nature, or to regulate a picture by
cartoon or design, relied for the whole on
practice and on chance, with the praise bestowed
on Razzi's composition, the faces that
speak, the breasts that palpitate, the torsos
compared by some to the antique, by others
to Michael Angelo, but by that indifference
which often distinguishes the man of genius
from the man of talent, him who possesses
by Nature from him who acquires by art?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Capacity and attachment unite not always;
and to Soddoma, vain, whimsical, volatile, art
appears to have been no more than the readiest
means of procuring amusement or pleasure.
"My art dances to the sound of your purse,"
said he to the Abbot of Monte Oliveto.</p>

<p>Agostino Chigi, pleased with the art, and
still more the whimsies of Soddoma, if we believe
Vasari, carried him to Rome, and introduced
him to Giulio II. to co-operate with
Pietro Perugino, &amp;c. in the Vatican; but his
labours being superseded by the novel powers
of Raffaelle, Agostino, whose attachments were
not regulated by the Pontiff's whims, employed
him in the decorations of his own palace,
now the Farnesina; where, in a principal apartment
leading to the great saloon reserved for
Raffaelle, he painted the Nuptials of Alexander
and Roxana in a style no doubt inferior to the
Loves of Amor and Psyche, but not of an inferiority
sufficient to account for the enormous
disparity of fame that separates both.</p>

<p>Domenico Mecherino,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the son of a Sienese
peasant, better known by the adopted name of
Beccafumi, inferior to Razzi in elegance of line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and suavity of colour, excelled him in energy
of conception and style. Vasari, who invests
Beccafumi with every excellence and virtue,
of which the defect or opposite vice disgraced
Razzi, still owns that he did not reach the
physiognomic suavity that marks the faces
of Soddoma; and after leading him from the
scanty elements of Pietro Perugino to Rome,
the Antique, the Chapel of M. Angelo, and the
works of Raffaelle, by a kind of anticlimax
brings him back to Siena to complete his studies
by adopting the principles of Giannantonio.
A modern writer,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> on the contrary, has discovered
that the talents of Domenico, overpowered
by the genius of M. Angelo, turned
their current awry, and failed to produce the
legitimate efforts which might have been expected
from a steady adherence to the principles
of Raffaelle&mdash;opinions less founded on
the character of the artist and the spirit of his
works than on the partiality and prejudice of
the critics. Beccafumi was not of the first
class, less made to lead than to follow with an
air of originality; to amalgamate principles not
absolutely discordant&mdash;thus, in single figures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
he sometimes more than imitates, he equals
M. Angelo, as in those noticed by Bottari;&mdash;and
again, in larger compositions, such as those
on the pavement of the Cathedral, works by
which he is chiefly known, we see him on the
traces of Raffaelle, and emulating the variety
and graces of Polydoro: these graces frequently
vanished, and correctness as often ceased with
the increased size of his figures: the foreshortenings,
in which he delighted, savour more of
the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto in su</span>," introduced by Correggio to
Upper Italy, than of the principles of M. Angelo;
they are generally attended by a magic chiaroscuro,
like that of the figure of Justice, on
which Vasari expatiates, on the ceiling of the
public hall at Siena, which, from profound
darkness gradually rising into light, seems to
vanish in celestial splendour. He is said by
Vasari to have preferred fresco and distemper
to oil paint, as a purer, simpler, and of course
more durable medium; and though the predominant
red of his flesh-tints has more freshness
than glow, such is the solidity of his
impasto and the purity of his method, that
his panels present us to this day less with
the injuries than the improvements of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p><p>The style of Mecherino did not survive
him: for Giorgio da Siena, his pupil, confined
himself to grotesque work, in imitation of
Giovanni da Udine; Giannella, or Giovanni of
Siena, turned to architecture: of Marco Pino,
commonly called Marco da Siena, his reputed
pupil, the style, decidedly built on the principles
of M. Angelo, renders all notion of his
having received more than the first rudiments
from Beccafumi or any other master, nugatory:
but the conjecture of Lanzi, that Domenico
was the master of Danielle Ricciarelli, known
to have begun his studies at Siena, though
unsupported by tradition, acquires an air of
probability less from the supposed mutual attachments
to M. Angelo, than the versatility
of their talents and similarity of pursuits.</p>

<p class="p2b">Baldassare Peruzzi,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> born in the diocese of
Volterra, but in the Sienese State, and of a
citizen of Siena, with considerable talents for
painting, possessed a decided genius in architecture.
His style of design is temperate
and correct, but quantity is the element of
his composition, if <i>indeed</i> an aggregate of
fortuitous figures deserve that name. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Adoration of the Magi, preserved in various
coloured copies from his original chiaroscuro,
embraces every fault of ornamental painting
without its only charm: it is not exaggeration to
say, that the principal figures are the least conspicuous,
that the leaders are sacrificed to their
equipage, that the architect every where crosses
the painter, and that the quadrupeds, however
brutally placed or impertinently introduced, for
conception, chiaroscuro, spirit and style, give to
the work what merit it can claim. The same
principle prevails in his fresco of the Presentation
at the Pace, and both are so evidently
opposite to Raffaello's system of composition,
that it is not easily understood how he could
be supposed to have been a pupil or imitator of
that master in propriety. If he resembles him
any where, it is in single expressions, as in the
Judgement of Paris at the Castello di Belcaro,
according to Lanzi; and still more in the prophetic
countenance of the celebrated Sibyl
predicting the birth of the Virgin to Augustus,
at Fonte Giusta, in Siena, whose divine enthusiasm
no prophetess of Raffaello has excelled,
and no Sibyl of Guido or Guercino approached.</p>

<p class="lecture">THE ROMAN SCHOOL.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> Roman School comprises, besides the
natives of the metropolis, those of the whole
Ecclesiastic State, Bologna, Ferrara, and some
part of Romagna excepted.</p>

<p>The origin of this school recedes into the
earlier periods of modern art, if we consider
Oderigi of Gubbio, a painter of miniature, contemporary
with Cimabue, as one of its founders.
His death, which preceded that of the Florentine
at least one year, the branch of art he exercised,
missal-painting, and what we know of
his situation, make it extremely improbable
that he owed the elements of design to that
master, with whom he seems to have had little
in common but the honour of rearing a pupil,
who in the sequel eclipsed his name, and became
the founder of another school.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps he made some scholars too at home:
in 1321 we find Cecco and Puccio of Gubbio,
engaged as painters to the Dome of Orvieto;
and about 1324, Guido Palmerucci Eugubino,
employed in the Town-hall of Gubbio; a few
half figures yet remaining of this evanescent
work are in a style not inferior to that of Giotto,
at whose period we are now arrived.</p>

<p>Giotto, at Rome, gave instructions to Pietro
Cavallini in painting and mosaic, and with what
success we may form some idea from the wonder-working
Christ in S. Paolo at Rome, the
Salutation at S. Marco of Florence, and a Crucifixion
at Assisi; a crowded composition of
soldiers, mob, and horses, varied in dress and
not ill discriminated by expression, with groups
of angels hovering over them in sable robes. In
vastness of conception and spirit it resembles
Memmi, and in one of the crucified men, foreshortening
is not unsuccessfully attempted;
the colours have still a degree of freshness,
especially the blue, which here and in other
places of the church forms, in the metaphor of
Lanzi, a ceiling of oriental sapphire.</p>

<p>After the demise of Cavallini, who, notwithstanding
a life of eighty-five years, appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
have left taste nearly in the state he found it;
a band of obscure and insignificant artists led
the art in a style neither Giottesque nor Greek
to the verge of the fifteenth century&mdash;that important
period when the Popes, re-established at
Rome, searched for the best hands to decorate
its Vatican and temples. The first name that
occurs, is that of Ottaviano Martis, whose Madonna
in S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria Nuova at Gubbio, bears the
date of 1403; she has a choir of stripling angels
round her in attitudes not ungraceful, but with
faces as like to each other as if they had all
been cast in one mould.</p>

<p>The name of Gentile da Fabriano is of more
consequence; it is he whose style Michael Angelo
compared to his name (Gentile.) About
1417 we find him at Orvieto among the
painters of its Dome, registered with the title
of Magister Magistrorum. Under Martin V.
he painted with Pisanello in the Lateran at
Rome: what he did there perished, and so
did his works in the public palace at Venice,
where he resided, was pensioned, and raised to
the rank of Patrician. "In that city," says
Vasari, "he was the master and like a parent
to Giacopo Bellini, the father of Giovanni
and Gentile Bellini, founders of the Venetian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
school and masters of Giorgione and
Tizian. Of his numerous works the remains
are in the Marca d'Ancona, the state of Urbino,
at Gubbio and Perugia: Florence still preserves
two of his pictures, one in S. Nicolo with the
image and histories of that bishop, another in
the sacristy of the Trinit&agrave;, with an Epiphany
and the date of 1423. His style resembles that
of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fr&agrave; Angelico da Fiesole</span>, with the exception
of forms less elegant, less female grace, and more
profusion of gold lace and brocade. <i>Antonio
da Fabriano</i>, with the date 1454, and <i>Bartholom&aelig;us
Magistri Gentilis de Urbino</i>, 1497 and
1508, are inscriptions on pictures at Matelica,
Pesaro, and Monte Cicardo, that have no other
claim to attention than the relation their names
seem to indicate with Gentile.</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piero della Francesca</span>, or <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Piero Borghese</span>,
an Umbrian, of Borgo S. Sepolcro, is a superior
name. He must have been born about 1398,
as, according to Vasari, his works were about
1458; he grew blind at sixty, and died eighty-five
years old. He was instructed in painting
at the age of fifteen, after having laid a foundation
in mathematics, and distinguished himself
in both. His beginnings were minute;
his master has escaped search. The first scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of his talent was the Court of Guidobaldo
Feltro the old, Duke of Urbino, where the perspective
of a vase drawn by him, provokes the
astonishment of his biographer; but besides
perspective, Painting owes to him her first
notions of the effects of light, of muscular precision,
and the method of preparing clay models
for the study of drapery.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>He painted much at Rome, and in the Floreria
of the Vatican there still exists a large
fresco reputed his, representing Niccolo V. with
some cardinals and prelates, whose faces interest
by a character of truth. At Arezzo, he seems
to have improved even upon Giotto and his
school, by the novelty of his foreshortenings,
vigour of tone, and powers which attended by
equal grace, would have set him on a level with
Masaccio.</p>

<p>Nicolo Alunno of Foligno, advanced the art
still farther; this is evident on comparing a
picture of his painted 1480, with another at S.
Nicolo of Foligno, dated 1492. The tone of
his colour, even in distemper, has novelty and
vigour; his heads have vivacity, though with
trivial and sometimes caricatured characters:
and in gilding he is moderate. Vasari, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
places him in the time of Pinturicchio, praises
above all a Piet&agrave; in a chapel of the Domo, in
which, he says, "there are two angels who
weep with such expression of grief, that, in
my opinion, no other painter, however excellent,
could have done much more."</p>

<p>Nor was Urbino without painters at this
period: Fiorillo names Lorenzo da San Severino.
At Urbino some pictures still remain of
Giovanni Sanzio, the father of Raphael, who
by the Duchess Giovanna della Rovere is
called a very ingenious artist: a foreshortened
figure of St. Sebastian, painted by him for the
church of that saint, has been imitated by Raphael
in an early picture of Our Lady's Wedding,
at Citt&agrave; di Castello. He subscribed himself
Io. Sanctis Urbi.; viz. Urbinas. Such at least is
the inscription on his Annunciation at Sinigaglia,
a work of high finish, but unequal in its parts,
and in the best, though less genial, approaching
the style of Pietro Perugino, with whom he had
for some time co-operated. But the most distinguished
Urbinese artist was Bartolommeo Corradini,
a Dominican, commonly called Fr&agrave; Carnevale:
at the Osservanza there is a picture of
his, defective in perspective, with draperies frittered
into the usual tatters of the time, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
with faces that breathe and speak, and airs of
dignity and ease: he was one of the first who
introduced portrait into historic composition,
a method adopted and often practised by Raphael,
who at Urbino had studied his works.</p>

<p>Perugia laid an early claim to Art, at least
as a craft. Mariotti tells of one Tullio a Perugine
painter about 1219, and in a long file
of quattrocentists, allots the most conspicuous
places to Lorenzo di Lorenzo, Bartolommeo
Caporali, whose works are dated about 1487, but
above all to Benedetto Bonfigli. Yet with this
abundance of home-bred artists, Perugia employed
in its public works the hands of strangers,
and chiefly Tuscans; it was to Florence,
States and Princes looked for that master-style
which could give splendour to a great commission.
When Sisto IV. planned the decorations
of the Sistina, the greater number of conscripts
for the work were Tuscans, and Pietro Perugino
the only artist drawn from his subjects
among them.</p>

<p>Pietro Vannucci, of Citt&agrave; della Pieve, as he
subscribed some pictures, or of Perugia, as he
did others, being a citizen of that place, studied,
if we believe Vasari, under a master of little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
eminence; but according to the more authentic
researches of Mariotti,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> was a pupil, and sufficiently
advanced himself by the instructions of
Bonfigli and Piero della Francesca, to finish his
style on the works of Giotto and Masaccio at
Florence, without entering the school of Verrocchio.</p>

<p>Those who have contemplated the works of
Pietro will without much difficulty discover
two styles of composition, form, colour, and execution:
the first was the result of the instructions
he received in the Roman, the second,
that of the impression made on his mind and
hand by the Tuscan School: what he painted
in oil and of small dimensions, generally belongs
to the first; what he executed in fresco
to the second period. There we find the hardness,
the haggard forms, the miserly scantiness
of drapery, the Gothic apposition and anxious
finish with which he is charged, relieved by
azure blues, emerald greens, violet and crimson
hues, the legacies of missal-painting, and a certain
air of juvenile and female grace, with
suavity of countenance and colour: beauties
which not only followed him in his second
style, but were rendered more impressive by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
rudiments of that breadth which seems to be
the privilege of fresco, by keeping, mellowness,
tone, and approaches to composition, as in the
altar-piece of the Kindred of the Saviour and
the fresco in the Hall of the Change, at Perugia.</p>

<p>Whilst the physiognomic monotony which
had hitherto dulled the human feature, began
to give way to expression and character in the
works of this period, it is not easy to explain
why its companion, that Gothic symmetry in
the arrangement of the whole, should not only
have been retained but aggravated into a studied
parallelism; not that pathetic repetition of
attitude and gesture which forces the moment
of the subject more irresistibly on the mind
than the most varied contrasts, but a nearly
rectilinear apposition, whose principal law was
to place, by a central figure, on each side of the
picture, an equal number of subordinate ones;
a law that extended itself to the most minute
detail, and bade buildings, flowers, clouds and
pebbles, re-echo each other; and all this in the
face of Giotto, whose Navicella, Death of Maria,
and other works, gave evidence that his composition
had, a century before, disdained to
move in the trammels which were now suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to check that of Pietro Perugino, and for no
inconsiderable time the composition of Raphael
himself.</p>

<p>Invention was not the element of Pietro.
His crucifixions, depositions, burials, ascensions,
and assumptions, are the brothers and sisters of
one family. He was blamed for this sterility
even in his own time, and defended himself by
saying that, if he possessed little, he owed nothing,
and that what had pleased in one place
could not displease in another. It does not indeed
offend to find the scenery of his St. Peter
receiving the keys in the Sistina, repeated in
the Wedding of our Lady at Perugia, and to
meet the beauties here concentrated which he
had singly scattered over various places.</p>

<p>Pietro had vigour of constitution and length
of life, and if he profited by the works of Raphael,
whom he outlived, might have done so
by those of Lionardo and Buonarroti. In few
men so many contradictory qualities seem to
have united: ridiculed for a degree of avarice,
which, it was said, made him withhold the necessary
drapery from his figures, he is yet allowed
by Vasari to have been greedier to accumulate
than sordid in the use of wealth, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
have pleased himself by marrying "a beautiful
damsel, whom he so much delighted in seeing
elegantly dressed both abroad and at home,
that he was often suspected of having dressed
her himself." By her he had children, but no
records enable us to judge of him as a parent.
That he was a good and kind master, is proved
by the numerous scholars he reared, and still more
by the pride which the most eminent and best of
them took, by introducing him more than once
in his works, to perpetuate with his own gratitude
the memory of his master. With this
kindness for his pupils, Pietro connected intolerance
of rivals and a mordacity of language,
which provoked Michael Agnolo to call him publicly
a dunce (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">goffo</i>) in art. His life was spent in
receiving commissions from the clergy, in meditating
and composing subjects of devotion;
and yet, if we believe his biographer, he carried
infidelity to a degree which resisted all
arguments for the immortality of the soul, and
with words dictated by an obstinacy worthy of his
marble brains,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> rejected all invitations to better
information. Of the numerous scholars whom
he had reared, the greater part followed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
manner with servile attachment; hence many
of their works have been ascribed to him, by
those who did not form their judgment at Perugia,
or at Florence in S<sup>ta</sup>. Chiara and the
Ducal palace: thus he pays forfeit for many
a holy family of Guerino da Pistoia, Rocco
Zoppo, or some other of his Tuscan scholars.
The best and least enthralled of his pupils belong
to the Roman school: Bernardino Pinturicchio,
less praised by Vasari than he deserves,
without the correctness of his master, and with
more Gothic profusion of gold-lace and brocade,
possesses magnificence of plan, expression of
countenance, and propriety of composition. Familiar
with Raphael, who was his assistant at
Siena, he made attempts to imitate his grace,
and sometimes not without success: at Rome,
the Vatican and Araceli Temple possess some
of his works; at Siena he painted, in ten pictures,
the history of Pio II. and added one of
Pio III. his employer, and these, with what he
left in the Dome of Spello, are the best of his
labours.</p>

<p>Of at more independent and grander spirit
was Andrea Luigi, of Assisi, surnamed <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">L'Ingegno</span>,
the Genius. He assisted Pietro in the
Change-hall at Perugia, and there and in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Prophets and Sibyls at Assisi, aggrandized and
mellowed the style of his master to a degree,
which led Sandrart, with others, to ascribe the
latter work to Raphael; but blindness checked
his career in the bloom of life, and left the art
to Raphael without a rival.</p>

<p>Domenico di Paris Alfani added, likewise,
some improvements to the style of Pietro. His
name was nearly sunk in that of his son or
brother Orazio, and time and dates alone have
re-asserted its right to some excellent works
long adjudged to the other; and which, were
it not for an insipid sweetness of tone bordering
on that of Baroccio, seem to have been inspired
by the principles of Raphael.</p>

<p>Of Pietro's many ultramontane pupils, Giovanni
Spagnuolo, a Spaniard, called <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lo Spagna</span>,
who settled at Spoleto, is considered by Vasari
as the most eminent. But all these names
united confer less celebrity on Pietro, than the
felicity of having reared the powers of Raffaello
Sanzio, if not the founder, the great establisher
of the Roman School.</p>

<p>Raffaello Sanzio, born at Urbino on Holy
Friday, April 1483, was the son of Giovanni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Sanzio, named among the contemporaries and
occasional helpers of Pietro, in whose school,
after having imparted the first rudiments of
Art to his son, conscious of his own inferiority,
he had the modesty to place him. Here his
progress was so rapid that he soon rendered
himself completely master of Vannucci's style,
soon became his favourite pupil, soon his co-adjutor,
and in a short period more than his
competitor: for though the pictures which he
painted at Civit&agrave; di Castello and Perugia, and
are so amorously dwelt on by Lanzi, still betray
in composition, design, and colour, the
principles of the master, they exhibit symptoms
of that expression, that beauty, those
simple graces, that refinement and precision of
finish, which not only had remained unknown
to Pietro, but in their purity were never attained
by any subsequent artist.&mdash;Some of
these are perceivable already, if scantily, in the
Procession to Golgotha, preceded by horsemen
and attended by the Madonna and her female
train; and still less perceptibly in one of its
predelle which exhibits the Saviour held extended
by his Mother, Magdalen and John:
they cannot be mistaken in the predelle which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
represents him among the sleeping disciples
praying in the garden,&mdash;performances of his
puerility, and most probably before he left the
school of Pietro.</p>

<p>After an enumeration of Raffaello's juvenile
works at Civit&agrave; di Castello and at Perugia, we
are told that he who ascribed Sanzio's art to
length of study and not to nature, was not
acquainted with the powers of his mind.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>That such was the verdict of Michael Agnolo,
is recorded by Condivi; and from aught that
appears, it does not seem either invidious or
incompetent. If Art be a complete system of
invariable rules, he only is a master of Art who
substantiates its precepts by equal uniformity
of execution and taste; and till he arrives
at that point, he can only be said to have
seized more or less of its parts in making approaches
to the whole, and to be indebted to
"study" and not to "nature," if he put himself
at last in possession of it.</p>

<p>Such was the progress of Raffaello; he arrived
by degrees at style in design, by degrees at
style in composition, by degrees at invention,
expression, and at what appeared to him colour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
His genius emancipated him from the shackles of
prescription and fashion, rapidly, if we compare
his progress with the shortness of his life or
the progress of the rest of his contemporaries,
but slowly, if we compare him with Michael
Angelo, whose system of Art seems to have
been born with him, whose infancy, virility,
age, exhibit one uniform principle. Every element
of the system displayed in the Capella
Sistina and on the tombs in S. Lorenzo, may
be traced in his essays at the garden of the
Medici and in the Holy Family painted for
Angelo Doni: but what eye will discover the
future painter of the Heliodorus, or the composer
of the Cartoons in the bridal arrangements
of our Lady's Wedding at Civit&agrave; di Castello,
or even in the Cartoons for the sacristy of the
Duomo at Sienna?</p>

<p>Though the commission of painting in that
place a series of the most memorable events in
the life of Pope Pio II. (a Siennese celebrated
by the name of Enea Silvio,) had been given
to Pinturicchio, who had sufficient modesty
and taste to avail himself of the superior and
growing powers of his friend,&mdash;it has been
asked what enterprise of equal magnitude had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in that infant state of Art ever been consigned
to a single hand, without considering that the
co-operation of Raffaello was adventitious, and
less owing to the opinion which he had established
of himself in the public mind than to
the modesty of Pinturicchio. And had not
Luca Signorelli singly been entrusted with a
work at Orvieto, whose tremendous and universally
interesting subjects beyond comparison
excelled whatever the embassies, the poetic and
papal honours, the canonization of a nun, the
ceremonies of a council, the death of the hero
himself, and the transportation of his corpse
from Ancona to Rome, however varied by character,
impressed by the sensibility of the artist,
or raised above the heraldry of the times, could
pretend to achieve beyond the precincts of
Sienna?</p>

<p>Whether Raffaello furnished the whole of
the Cartoons for that work, or only part, cannot
be ascertained from the contradictory account
of Vasari,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> who in the life of Pinturicchio asserts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the first, and in that of Raffaello, the second.
As he, however, did not leave Sienna for
Florence till 1504, it is probable that he continued
to assist his friend in completing the
whole historic series: the work itself is in perfect
preservation, and though better informed
eyes than those of Bottari<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> might not be competent
to discriminate the parts which exclusively
belong to Raffaello, it is certain that
in the progress of the pictures there is an evident
progress toward style.</p>

<p>Aggrandisement of style might reasonably
be supposed to have been the motive that
drew Raffaello to Florence. The David of
M. Angiolo was placed; he had begun his
cartoon, which from its very inaccessibility,
and the high character of the artist whom it
opposed, must have been an object of eager
curiosity to the public, and of tremulous expectation
to the student. Florence was, no
doubt, at that period divided into two technic
factions, Vinciists and Bonarotists; it
does not, however, appear that Raffaello adhered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
to either of the two leaders; neither
the learning and energy of Bonaroti, nor the
magic chiaroscuro of Lionardo, could divert
the future painter of the passions from his
course; he therefore attached himself to the
study of Masaccio, as a more direct guide to
the drama. The implicit application of that
master's conceptions in the same or similar
subjects, when he was in the vigour of his
powers, if it be the most celebrated proof of
this, is a less convincing one than the similarity
of taste and vein of thought which pervades
their works, and might, to men of bolder
conjecture than I pretend to, prove that Masaccio
might have been what Raffaello was,
had time and means conspired.</p>

<p>According to the account of Vasari,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Raffaello
went three times to Florence: the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
time when, according to the biographer, roused
by the fame of Lionardo and M. Angiolo, he
left the partnership of Pinturicchio, 1504&mdash;the
date of the recommendatory letter with the
affixed name of Joanna Feltria, Duchess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Urbino, addressed to the Gonfaloniere Pietro
Soderini, and said to be still preserved at Florence
among the papers of the Gaddi family.
Supposing the date of the letter (1st October,
1504) to be correct, and the writer of it to
have been acquainted with the person she recommends,
its genuineness, as Fiorillo observes,
is liable to strong suspicion. Its expressions
might fit a lad of ten or twelve years, but certainly
not a young man of one-and-twenty,
the age of Raffaello, who had painted many
pictures, was at that very time employed in a
great public work, and only three years after
was called to Rome by Giulio the Second.</p>

<p class="p2b">Though Raffaello's talents had spread his
name, and attracted the attention and the
wishes of Giulio the Second to employ him in
the decoration of the Vatican, it may be presumed
that the persuasive influence of his relative,
Bramante Lazzari, decided the Pontiff to
distinguish him by that immediate and exclusive
call to Rome, which raised him above all
rival competition, and opened the most splendid
period of his life, most probably 1507. Which
was the picture he began with, would not have
been contested by his biographers, encomiasts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and critics, from Vasari to Mengs, had they
attended less to hearsay, for tradition it cannot
be called, than to the evidence of the works
themselves. To date the dispute on the Sacrament
after the School of Athens, equally inverts
the progressive powers of the artist in
conception, taste, style, and execution. Everywhere
that composition betrays a young performer,
enviably successful in each individual
part, but whom experience has not yet enabled
to spread an harmonious whole. The connection
of its upper with the lower scene, less
divided than rent asunder, depends entirely
on a mental effort in the spectator. The parallelism
of the celestial synod, impresses more
with formal monotony than awful energy, and
the ostentatious abuse of gold impairs its dignity.
In the lower part of the picture, less
sublime than dramatic, the artist moves in
his own element; its parallelism and its contrasts,
no longer the result of ceremonious symmetry,
but of the inspiring principle, warms
contemplation to sympathy, and its characteristic
correctness exhibits in Raffaello's own
unassisted, or rather unalloyed hand, the
style of the School of Athens, the Mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Bolsena, the female part of the Heliodorus,
and with a felicity unattained in the Parnassus
and the Attila,&mdash;the more ample outlines and
the increased volume of forms in the Angels,
and the Heliodorus and his accomplices on the
foreground.</p>

<p class="blquot"><i>A description of two Drawings by Raffaello, from an
account of the Collection of Drawings and Prints
in the Gallery of Duke Albrecht, of Sachsen Teschen,
at Vienna</i>.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>Two naked male figures, apparently studies
from Nature, on one leaf, drawn in red chalk:
one with nearly all his back turned to the eye,
rests the left hand on his hip, and with the
right points to something before him. Somewhat
behind you see the other, sideways, in
perfect repose, leaning with both hands on a
long spear-like staff; the background has some
rudiments of a sketched head. To the right of
the spectator, at the side of the first figure, you
read, "1515, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Raffahell di Urbin der so hoch
vom Pobst geacht ist gwest, hat diese nakte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>

<p>That Raffaello in his last years, and when at
the height of his celebrity, did exchange drawings
with Albert Durer, is attested by the biographers
of both: and that the design here described
is one of that number, is incontestably
proved, not only by the peculiarity of style,
the elegance and facility of outline, the characteristic
contrast of solid and muscular parts,
but by the identity of the handwriting with
the manuscripts of Albert still existing at
N&uuml;rnberg, his native city.</p>

<p>I therefore think it no improbable conjecture
to suppose that Raffaello, by transmitting this
specimen of his hand to Albert, intended to
make him sensible of the difference between
imitating Nature and dryly copying a model,
and so impress him with the necessity of contrasting
his outline according to the different
texture of the parts in the bodies before
him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>
<p class="p2b">This interesting leaf is one foot three inches
three lines in height, and ten inches eight lines
in width, Vienna measure; and in perfect preservation.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>This design differs in nothing from the well-known
picture of the Transfiguration, but the
absolute nudity of all the figures.</p>

<p>That Raffaello was accustomed to sketch in
naked outlines, may be known from most collections
that possess something of his hand;
but perhaps none but this may be able to produce
a design, of a numerous and complete
composition, in which every figure is rendered
with anatomical correctness and finished chiaroscuro.</p>

<p>Another singularity of this important leaf
is, the characteristic disparity of execution in
the figures; for though all are drawn with the
pen, and on the first glance seem hatched in
one uniform manner, it soon appears on close
inspection, that they cannot have been produced
by the same hand.</p>

<p>The figures of the three Disciples on the
Mount, especially the foreshortened one, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
treated with that spirited facility and confident
decision which always mark the pen of Raffaello.
Those of the Saviour and the collateral
prophets, though drawn with less precision and
contours here and there, by repeated strokes, corrected,
still exhibit on the whole the same spirit,
facility, and confidence of hand. Of the actors
below, the figure of John, with hands crossed
on his breast, and the three next to him have
the same Raffaellesque characteristics, and so
the whole of the females kneeling on the foreground;
but of the adjoining apostle, with the
book in his hand, the projected leg and foot
are absolutely out of drawing; whilst the Demoniac
and his father, with all the remaining
figures, drawn by mere practice, without a
symptom of the master spirit, give palpable
proofs of a different hand.</p>

<p>It appears no improbable conjecture that
Raffaello, after settling the plan and fully arranging
the figures of his picture, drew the
nudities of this design as the bases of his draperies:
for this reason only, the principal parts
of the forms, and those muscles that would act
most visibly on the draperies, are designed correctly,
and finished with decision; whilst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
heads, and what was either to be naked in the
picture or did not act immediately on the drapery,
remained in careless and superficial lines.</p>

<p>That Raffaello suffered parts of his Transfiguration,
and in my opinion some of the most
important parts, to receive all but the last finish
from a pupil, if tradition had not told us,
there is ocular demonstration in the picture
itself. The proportions of the Demoniac's
father are neglected as a whole, in relation of
limb to limb, and the figure is sacrificed to
place. The face of Christ himself, as it was
seen in the Louvre, is unworthy of Raffaello's
hand and conception.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The reason why some of the figures are
drawn in the true spirit of the artist, and others
in a bald and insignificant manner, may be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that after slightly sketching the whole, he gave
his own finish in the design to those parts only
which he intended to execute with his own
hand in the picture; and less solicitous for the
rest, left them to the hand of some inferior
pupil.</p>

<p>The height of this extraordinary design is
one foot eight inches four lines; its breadth
one foot two inches five lines; it is without
injury.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>Taddeo and Federigo Zuccari, the first declared
mannerists of this school, sons of Ottaviano
Zuccari, a mediocre painter of S. Angiolo
in Vado, came to Rome successively, formed
a school, and filled towns and states with an immense
farrago of good, tolerable, and bad pictures.
From the instructions of Pompeo da
Fano and Giacomone da Faenza, but chiefly
from an obstinate study of Raffaello's works,
Taddeo, at no protracted period, gathered
enough to diffuse over his own, an air, though
not reality, of style, and to anticipate by contrivance
and facility the rewards which time
owes to invention and genius. Courting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
senses of the multitude, he became the hero of
the day; they saw their portraits in his faces,
their limbs in his forms, their action in his
attitudes; his draperies, hair, beards, had a cut
of fashion. The simplicity of his disposition is
often contrasted by half figures emerging from
his foregrounds; perhaps less from a principle
of imitating his more remote predecessors, than
to invigorate the effect of his <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaroscuro</span>, a
method not unknown to Parmegiano.</p>

<p>Rome possesses vast works in fresco of Taddeo;
among the best of these are some Gospel
stories at the Consolazione. He seldom painted
in oil, and less commendably in large than small:
some of these are cabinet pictures of exquisite
finish,&mdash;such a one, (formerly in the collection
of the Duke of Urbino, but more recently
at Osimo in the Palace Leopardi,) is the Nativity
of the Saviour, and in Taddeo's very best style.
But the work on which his fame chiefly rests,
are the paintings of the Palazzo Farnese, at
Caprarola (engraved in a moderate volume, by
Prenner, 1748). They represent the Feats of
the Farnese Family, in peace and war; to
which are joined other stories, both sacred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
profane; but what attracts attention most, is
the celebrated "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Stanza del Sonno</span>," an apartment
dedicated to Sleep, replete with a great
variety of allegoric imagery, suggested to him
by Annibale Caro, in a long, quaint letter,
printed among his familiar ones, and reproduced
among the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lettere Pittoriche</span>," t. iii.
l. 99.</p>

<p>Dissimilar in the pursuits of life, Taddeo
resembled Raffaello in death; he completed
thirty-seven years, and obtained a monument
close to Sanzio, in the "Rotonda."</p>

<p>His brother and pupil Federigo, inferior in
design, resembles him in taste, though more
mannered, more capricious in conceit, more
crowded in composition. He completed what
death had prevented Taddeo from finishing in
the Sala Regia, that of Farnese, the Trinit&agrave; de'
Monti, and elsewhere, with the airs of heir-at-law
to his brother's talents. Thus he raised an
opinion of capacity for greater enterprise, and
was invited by Francis I. to paint the great
Cupola of the metropolitan church at Florence,
which death alone had saved from Vasari's
hands. There Federigo painted more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
three hundred figures of fifty feet in height each,
besides that of Lucifer, "so enormous," to use
his own phrase, "that it makes the other figures
appear infants;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>&mdash;figures," he adds, "larger
than the world ever witnessed before in Art."
So little, however, hugeness excepted, is there
to admire in this work, that at the time of Pier
da Cortona, a painting of that master would have
been substituted for it, had it not been feared
that he would not live long enough to terminate
the whole. After the Cupola, every work
of consequence at Rome appeared his due, and
he was recalled by Gregorio to paint the ceiling
of the Paolina, and give a successor to Michael
Angelo. It was at that period, that, on a charge
preferred against him by some courtiers or
domestics of Gregorio, he painted and exhibited
the picture of Calumny, and his accusers
with asses-ears, which raised a clamour that
obliged him to fly from Rome. During his
exile, which lasted some years, he visited Flanders,
Holland, England; had a call even from
Venice to paint a subject in the Ducal Palace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was everywhere caressed and remunerated, and,
the Pope being mitigated, returned to reassume
his interrupted labours in the Capella; the best
work perhaps which, without the assistance of
his brother, he has produced at Rome, though
the larger altar-piece of S. Lorenzo in Damaso,
and that of the Angioli at Ges&ugrave;, with some
others dispersed in other churches, may claim
their share of merit. He built a house on
Monte Pincio, rapidly and with the assistance
of his scholars furnished with family portraits,
conversations, and other whims in fresco, and
left to prove him a trifler in Art, and the
leader of decay.</p>

<p>Invited by Philip II. he went to Madrid,
but failed to please; his place was supplied by
Tibaldi, and he sent back with a good pension
to Italy. Towards the end of his life he
made another journey, scouring the principal
towns of Italy, and leaving his works
wherever he could place them: of these the
Assumption of the Madonna in an oratorio at
Rimini on which he wrote his name, and her
Death at S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria in Acumine of the same
place, with figures more than usually studied,
deserve notice. His Presepio in the Duomo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of Foligno, has simplicity and grace; nor less
have the two stories relative to the Madonna,
painted for the Duke of Urbino in a chapel at
Loretto. The Miracle of the Snow, in the library
of the Cistercians at Milano, is a multitudinous
composition filled with portraits as
usual, variously coloured and well preserved.
The Borromean College at Pavia, has a saloon
painted in fresco from incidents in the life of S.
Carlo: the most approved of these is the Saint
praying in his recess: nor might the other two,
that of the consistory in which he received
the Cardinal's hat, and the Pest of Milano,
want commendation had they overflowed less in
figures. At Torino he painted for the Jesuits
a St. Paul; began to ornament a gallery for the
Duke, Charles Emanuel; published his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Idea
de' Pittori Scultori ed Architetti</i>, and dedicated it
to the Duke. This was followed, at his return to
Lombardy, by two other treatises; "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La dimora
di Parma del Sig. Cav. Federico Zuccaro</i>; and
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il passaggio per Italia, colla dimora di Parma
del Sig. Cav. Federigo Zuccari</i>," both printed
at Bologna 1608. Next year, on his return to
Rome, he fell sick at Ancona, and there died.
His talents, which extended to sculpture and
architecture, were inferior to his fortune, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
preceded that of all his contemporaries, and was
in a great measure the effect of personal qualities;
lordly aspect and demeanour, some literary
culture, persuasive manners, and a liberality
that absorbed the wealth which his hand
had accumulated.</p>

<p>Emulation seems to have been his chief
motive of writing: he longed to break a lance
with Vasari, whom, from whatever cause, as
appears from the postils tacked to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vite</i>, he
disliked. They have been sometimes, especially
in the Life of Taddeo, quoted and treated as
effusions of envy and malignity by the annotator
of the Roman edition. To prove his superiority
over the Tuscan, he chose a style as
obscure and inflated as that of Giorgio is diffuse
and plain; the whole of the treatise printed
at Torino reels in a round of internal and external
design, and contains less precept than
peripatetic speculation, which rendered the
schools of that day more loquacious than
learned. His language runs over in intellective<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
and formative conceits, in substantial substances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and formal forms; even the titles of his
chapters are larded with equal fulsomeness of
phrase, like that of the XIIth., that "philosophy
and to philosophize, is metaphoric and
similitudinarious design." These are the bait of
fools&mdash;for none but fools can hope to gather
meaning from the bubbles of sophistry, or
stoop to disentangle etymologies which derive
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">disegno</i> from "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dei signum</span>," the sign of God!</p>

<p>This treatise was probably the offspring of
his presidency in the Academy of St. Luke; for
office gives insolence. The Academy dates its
origin from the Pontificate of Gregorio XIII.,
who granted the brief of its foundation<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> to
Muziano. It had not, however, its full effect
till after the return of Zuccari from Spain,
who put it in force and was unanimously declared
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Principe</span>," or President. That was his
day of triumph; he returned from the inauguration
in the church of S. Martino at the foot
of the Campidoglio, accompanied by a great
concourse of artists and litterators to his own
house, where shortly after he built a saloon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
for the accommodation of the Academy, in
whose praise he overflowed in prose and poems,
more than once quoted in his larger treatise;
and to seal his extreme affection, bequeathed
like Muziano, in case his own line should fail,
the bulk of his fortune to the establishment.</p>

<p>Giuseppe Cesari, sometimes distinguished by
the name of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Cavaliere d'Arpino</span>,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> his native
place, was in art what Marino was in poetry&mdash;brilliancy
without substance is the characteristic
of both, and either proved the ancient
observation, that Arts and Republics receive
the greatest damage from the greatest capacities.
The talent of Cesari bubbled up from
his infancy, made him an object of admiration,
procured him through F. Danti, the protection
of Gregorio XIII., and in a short time the
reputation of the first master at Rome. Less
than the felicity with which he is said to have
executed some pictures from certain designs of
M. Agnolo, in the possession of Giacomo
Rocca, his exuberance alone was sufficient to
establish supremacy of name among a race
who measured genius by quantity, and science
by confidence of method. If his numbers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
rabble, he arranged them with the skill of a
general; if common-place furnished him with
features, arrogance of touch brushed them into
notice; and the horses which he drew with
equal truth and fire, supplied the incorrectness
or imbecility of the rider. The excellence of his
colour in fresco, the gaiety which he spread
over a vast surface, hid from the common eye
monotony of manner, poverty of character, and
want of finish in the detail of parts.</p>

<p class="p2b">They were observed, reprobated and opposed
by M.A. Caravaggio, A. Caracci, and the few
who saw and thought with them. Quarrels
arose, and challenges were given: that of Caravaggio,
Cesari refused to accept, because he had
not yet been knighted, and Annibale rejected
that of Cesari, because, said he, "I know no
other weapon than my pencil." They both
experienced the difference of the difficulties
that attend legislation and reform of taste,
and were left ineffectually to struggle with an
empiric, who outlived either upwards of thirty
years, and then left a race worse than himself
behind him.</p>

<p>According to this account of Vasari, Raffaelle went three
times to Florence; the first time, when roused by the fame
of Lionardo and Michael Angelo, he left Pinturicchio 1504,
and continued at Florence till he was called away by the
death of his mother to Urbino, from whence, having settled
his affairs, and painted certain things, he went to Perugia,
and after some public works there, returned again to Florence
with a commission from A. Baglioni. This is the
period fixed by Vasari of his acquaintance with Bartolomeo
di S. Marco, the progressive improvements of his style,
and his pictures for A. Doni and D. Canigiani, and must
have been his longest stay in that capital, though interrupted
by a new call to Perugia, during which he finished
the picture of the Burial of Christ, now in the Borghese
Palace, for the Chapel Baglioni, and then returned for the
third time to Florence.</p></div>

<p class="lecture">THE SCHOOL OF NAPLES.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Social</span> refinements and elegance of taste in
arts had shed their splendour over the Hesperian
colonies of Greece long before Rome had
learnt to value more than the ploughshare and
the sword; Herculaneum, Stabi&aelig;, Pompeii,
with their still remaining multitude and variety
of legitimate monuments, prove that a technic
school of eminence flourished in the Neapolitan
states after they had been incorporated
with the Roman empire; and what time has
spared or tradition recorded of the attempts
made by Goths, Greeks, Longobards, Saracens,
and Normans, to repair their waste of desolation,
sufficiently shows, that though the art
itself at intervals vanished, the craft still subsisted
during the gloom of the middle ages.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>But not to soil these pages with too much
legend, we date the revival of Neapolitan art
from the name of Tommaso de' Stefani, born
1230, the contemporary of Cimabue and Charles
of Anjou, who, though on his passage through
Florence he had been led to visit that object of
Tuscan dotage, on his establishment at Naples
employed Tommaso in his new-founded church;
a questionable honour, of which a native writer<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
avails himself to insinuate the superiority of his
countryman over Cimabue, as if the suffrage of
a prince could defeat the evidence of works, or
stand against the verdict of Marco da Siena,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
who from them, judged him inferior to the
Florentine in grandeur of style and breadth.</p>

<p>The favours of Charles were continued to
Tommaso by his successor, and emulated by
the principal families of the city; the chapel
de' Minutoli, named by Boccaccio, was storied
by him with subjects drawn from the Saviour's
passion; and others from the life of S. Gennaro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and some sainted bishops, by his hand, are
said still to exist in a roomy chapel of the ancient
Episcopio. Some semblance of the same
saint in S. Angelo a Nido, formerly S. Michele,
is considered as his work, and some fragments
have survived of others, with dates of 1270 and
1275. He was the master of Filippo Tesauro,
who painted in the church of S. Restituta
the life of S. Nicholas the Hermit, the only
fresco of his which has reached our time.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>About 1325, Giotto was invited by King
Robert to Naples, for the purpose of painting
the church of S<sup>ta</sup>. Chiara; he came and filled it
with Gospel history, and apocalyptic mysteries,
from inventions, said in the time of Vasari to
have been formerly communicated to him by
Dante. These works, because they darkened
the church, were whitewashed in the beginning
of the last century, with the exception of a
Madonna called della Grazia, and some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
sainted image, preserved by female piety.
Giotto conducted other works in S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria
Coronata, and still others, which no longer
exist in the Castle dell' Uovo. Maestro Simone,
a Cremonese, according to some, but more probably
a native of Naples, was the chosen partner
of these works, and from so distinguished a
choice, acquired some celebrity himself: from
the resemblance of his style to Tesauro and to
Giotto, he might have been the pupil of either,
and was perhaps of both. Certain it is, that
after the departure of Giotto, he received from
Robert and Queen Sancia, many important
commissions for various churches, and especially
that of S. Lorenzo; there he painted
Robert receiving the crown from his brother
Lewis, Bishop of Toulouse, but died before
he could finish the compartment of the chapel
dedicated to that prelate after his demise and
canonization. Though confessedly inferior in
invention, character, and suavity of tone, he
has nearly reached Giotto in some of his works:
such as the dead Christ supported by his mother,
in the church dell' Incoronata, and the
Madonna with the Infant, on a gold-ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
now in the convent of the church della Croce,
supposed by some to have been painted in oil.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Simone had a son, Francesco di Simone, who
died in 1360. His works are not numerous,
but what has reached our days in the Capitolo
di S. Lorenzo, is distinguished by an air
of superior dignity and grace. Two other pupils
of Simone, Gennaro di Cola and Stefanone,
a similarity of manner associated in several
public works, such as the chapel of S.
Lewis, begun by Simone, and what still exists
in S. Giovanni da Carbonara of subjects relative
to our Lady. They are similar, however,
without monotony. Gennaro, impressed by the
difficulties of his art, and bent to overcome
each obstacle by labour, appears precise, studied,
and hard. Stefanone, guided by a spirit
which in better days might have been called
genius, boldly executed what he had conceived
with warmth.</p>

<p>The pretended improvements of Colantonio del
Fiore, (born 1352, died 1444,) a pupil of Francesco,
neither appear to have been considerable
enough in themselves, nor sufficiently authenticated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
to place him at the head of a new epoch
in style. Those barbarous relics of the middle
ages, that meagerness of contour, dryness of
colour, and want of perspective, which he is
said to have abolished, had in a great measure
vanished before, at the glance of Giotto. The
gold grounds continued after both;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and if in
enumerating some of his works his encomiast
is in doubt whether they may not rather belong
to M. Simone, what is it but a tacit
confession, that the art had made no considerable
progress during the course of a century?</p>

<p>The life of Colantonio grasped nearly the half
of two centuries, and the refinements for which
he has been extolled must be looked for in
those of his works, on whose authenticity there
is no hesitation, produced on the verge of life.
Such is the Madonna, &amp;c. in S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria Nuova,
a compound of harmonious hues, though painted
on a gold ground; and still more in S. Lorenzo,
Saint Jerome drawing a thorn from the
lion's foot, the date 1436, a picture full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
truth, in high esteem with foreigners, and for
its better preservation removed by the fathers
of the convent from the church itself to the
sacristy. He had a scholar in Angiolo Franco,
who has obtained the praise of Marco di Siena,
for having invigorated the most successful imitation
of Giotto by the tone and chiaroscuro of
his master.</p>

<p>But a name of far greater importance to art
is that of Antonio Solario, commonly called
Lo Zingaro, the reputed son-in-law of Colantonio.
His story, still more romantic than that
which in Quintin Metsis transformed a blacksmith
to a painter, tells that Solario, bred to
the forge, became enamoured of a daughter of
Colantonio, forsook the anvil, and by successful
submission to a ten years' trial of painting, and
the mediation of a queen, obtained the idol of
his soul. Let those who told the tale vouch for
its truth: what is less disputable, and interests
this history more, are his travels from Naples
to Bologna, where for several years he studied
under Lippo Dalmasio, and from thence over
Italy, to become acquainted with the principles
of other masters; those of Vivarini at Venice;
of Bicci at Florence; of Galasso at Ferrara; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Pisanello and Gentile da Fabriano at Rome.
These two, it is believed that he assisted, and
Luca Giordano asserted that some heads in
their pictures at the Lateran bore the legitimate
marks of Solario's pencil. In heads he
excelled; he inspired them, according to Marco
da Siena, with the air of life. In perspective,
if the times be weighed, his skill was considerable;
in composition not contemptible. There
is variety in his scenery; and if his dresses be
not drapery, they are at least naturally folded.
In the design of the extremities he was less
happy; his attitudes often border on caricature,
as his colour on crudeness. On his return
to Naples, nine years after his departure,
applauded by Colantonio and the public, he
enjoyed the patronage of King Alfonso. His
greatest work is the Life of S. Benedetto, in
the compartments of the cloister of S. Severino,&mdash;frescoes
filled with an incredible variety
of objects. Other churches possess some
altarpieces by him: he left many portraits and
some very attractive Madonnas; but in the
Dead Christ of S. Domenico Maggiore, and the
S. Vincent of S. Pier Martire, including some
stories of that Saint's life, he is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
excelled himself. Zingaro reared a school,
which with more or less felicity disseminated
his principles for nearly half a century, and
retained his name. Of its pupils, Niccola di
Vito, long forgot in his works, is barely remembered
as a buffoon; Simone Papa and
Angiotillo di Roccadirame, scarcely emerged
to mediocrity; Pietro and Ippolito (Polito) del
Donzello deserve less transient attention. Sons-in-law
of Angiolo Franco, and pupils of Giuliano
da Majano in architecture, they were,
according to Vasari,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> employed by him to decorate
with paintings the fabric of Poggio
Reale, which he had constructed for King
Alfonso, where, continuing to operate under
his son and successor Ferdinand, they represented
the story of the Conspiracy formed
in against him, a work celebrated by Jacopo
Sannazaro.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Ippolito, alone or with his brother,
filled the refectory of S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria Nuova with
a number of subjects for the same prince,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and then retired to Florence, where, not
long after, he died. Piero remained at Naples
distinguished and followed. Their style
is that of their master, but with more suavity
of colour. The first successful imitation of
friezes, trophies, and storied basso-relievoes in
chiaroscuro, may with probability be dated
from them. That Pietro excelled in portraits,
is evident from some animated heads saved
among the ruins of certain frescoes of his on
a wall of the Palace Matalona. Both were,
however, surpassed in tone, and force of light
and shade, and mellowness of outline, by Silvestro
de Buoni, their pupil, whose pictures,
scattered over the temples of Naples, have
been enumerated by Dominici. Silvestro himself
yields to Tesauro of questionable name,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
whose works approach much nearer to the succeeding
epoch than the united labours of his
predecessors in vigour of invention, in judgment,
propriety of attitude, truth of expression,
and general harmony of the whole, with
a relief beyond what seems credible in an artist
unacquainted with other schools and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
works than those of his native place. Such
was his power of execution, that it challenged
the wonder of Luca Giordano in the vigour
of his career, when he contemplated the ceiling
of San Giovanni de' Pappacodi, where
Tesauro had painted the Seven Sacraments.
They have been minutely described, and
the portraits of Alfonso II. and of Ippolita
Sforza, whom he is said to have represented,
for the work itself is no more, in the Sacrament
of Matrimony, afford some light as to the
time in which it was painted. Another of his
works, equally praised, in the Chapel Tocco
of the Episcopal church, which represented a
series of subjects from the life of Saint Asprenas,
perished under the hands of one of
Solimena's pupils. He was the father or uncle
of Raimo Epifanio Tesauro, a considerable
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Frescante</span>, who, according to Stanzioni, rekindled
the evanescent spark of Zingaro's principles.
Some few vestiges of his works remain
in S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria Nuova and Monte Vergine.
His dates reach from 1480 to 1501, and he
may be considered as the last of this school, for
Gio. Antonio d'Amato acquired fame by abandoning
its style for that of Pietro Perugino.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p><p>Such were the masters that marked the first
epoch of the Neapolitan school; neither inconsiderable
in number, nor contemptible in progress,
for a state nearly always perplexed by
war: it derives, however, its greatest lustre
from having produced within the state the memorable
artist whose resolution and perseverance
made Italy mistress of the new-discovered
method in oil-painting, and changed the face of
art.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Antoniello, a Messinese, of the Antonj family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
universally known by the name of Antoniello
da Messina, educated, according to Vasari, to
the art at Rome, returned from that place to
Sicily, and after some successful practice at Palermo
and Messina, sailed to Naples, where he
saw an historical picture painted in oil by John
ab Eyk, which had been presented or disposed
of to king Alfonso, by some Florentine
traders. Charmed by the method, Antoniello
forgot every other concern, passed into Flanders,
and by close attendance, and some presents
of Italian designs, captivated the heart of
the old painter, who made him completely
master of the secret, and soon after died. Antoniello
then left Flanders, and after some
months spent at Messina, repaired to Venice,
where he practised with general admiration of
his new method; communicated it to Domenico
there, and he at Florence to the felon
Castagna, till by gradual progress it embraced
all Italy. What remains to be related of Antoniello,
is reserved for the history of the Venetian
school, to which by residence and practice
he properly belongs, and which alone carried
his new discovered method to the height
it was capable of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
The second epoch of Neapolitan art was auspicious.
P. Perugino had painted for the Cathedral
an Assumption of the Virgin, now
lost, a work which led to a better taste. Already,
Amato, as we observed, had abandoned
the manner of Zingaro to follow Pietro, though
his style had still too much of the former to
form more than the connecting link between
the two epochs; when Raffaello and his school
came into vogue, Naples was the first of exterior
towns to profit by them, and they,
about the middle of the century, were followed
by some adherents of Michael Angiolo; nor
till near 1600, was any attention paid to other
masters, if we except Tiziano.</p>

<p>The new series begins with Andrea Sabbatini<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
of Salerno. Smitten with the style of P.
Perugino, Andrea set out for Perugia, to enter
his school; but hearing some painters at an inn
on the road talk of Raffaello and the Vatican,
he altered his mind and route, and went to
Rome. Though not long under the guidance
of Sanzio, being by the death of his father,
1513, obliged to return to Naples, he returned
another man. He is said to have painted with
Raffaello at the Pace and in the Vatican. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
good copyist, and what is rare, a better imitator,
if he did not soar with Giulio, he kept
pace with the best of that school, and excelled
some in correctness, and a style equally remote
from affectation and manner, with depth of
chiaroscuro, breadth of drapery, and a colour
which has defied time. His works in oil and
fresco, scattered over the metropolis and the
kingdom at large, have been celebrated as miracles
of art, though now either lost or greatly
impaired.</p>

<p>Of his scholars all persevered not in his manner:
thus Cesare Turco, as commendable in
oil as unsuccessful in fresco, drew nearer to P.
Perugino. More of Andrea was retained by
Francesco Santafede, the father and master of
Fabrizio,&mdash;painters whom few of that school
equal in colour, and so uniform that their
works can only be discriminated by the superior
tinge and chiaroscuro of the father. But
the scholar who most resembled Andrea was
one Paolillo, whose works, nearly all ascribed
to his master, till restored to their real author
by Dominici, leave little doubt of his right to
the first honours of that school, had his career
not been intercepted by a violent death, occasioned
by intrigue. Polidoro Caldara, of Caravaggio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
escaped to Naples in 1527, from the
sack of Rome, but not, as Vasari with less information
than credulity relates, to starve. Received
in the house of Andrea, formerly his
fellow scholar, he soon acquired acquaintance,
commissions, and even formed pupils before
his departure for Sicily. He had been celebrated
for his chiaroscuros at Rome: at Naples
and Messina he attempted colour. The shadowy
and pallid specimens he has left, leave a
doubt whether he would ever have arrived at
a degree of strength or brilliancy worthy of
invention and style, though he has been praised
with enthusiasm by Vasari for the colour of
the Christ led to Calvary, a numerous composition,
and the last before his assassination at
Messina.</p>

<p>Gian Bernardo Lama left the school of
Amato to attach himself to Polidoro, whom he
more than once imitated with sufficient success
to incur the suspicion of having been assisted
by the master: he had, however, more sweetness
than energy, and, in the sequel, was noted
for his opposition to the vigorous inroads of the
Tuscan style and the prevalence of Marco di
Pino.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p><span lang="spa" xml:lang="spa">Francesco Rubiales</span>, a Spaniard, from his felicity
of imitation called Polidorino, is likewise
named in Naples among the scholars of
Caldara, whom he assisted in painting for the
Orsini, and singly conducted several works at
Monte Oliveto, and elsewhere, the greater part
of which are no more.</p>

<p>There are who class with the scholars of Polidoro,
Marco Cardisco, called Marco <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Calabrese</span>.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
Him Vasari prefers to all the natives of that
epoch, and admires as a plant sprung from a
soil not its own: he knew not, perhaps, that, of
Magna Grecia, modern Calabria was the spot
most favoured by the arts. Possessed of a dextrous
hand and florid colour, Cardisco spread
his labours over Napoli and the State: of what
remains, the most praised is the Dispute of
Saint Augustine at Aversa. Gio. Batista Crescione
and Lionardo Castellani are slightly
mentioned by Vasari as his scholars.</p>

<p>Gio. Francesco Penni, called "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Fattore</span>,"
came to Naples some time after Polidoro; and,
during the short time which he lived, for he
died in 1528, contributed to the advancement
of the art by leaving his great copy of Raffaello's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Transfiguration and his pupil Lionardo
Grazia, of Pistoia, behind him, a name more
celebrated for colour, and far less for design,
than might have been expected from a nurseling
of the Roman School. He is said to have
been one of the masters of Francesco Curia,
who went to Rome to study the style of Raffaello,
but returned with the manner of Zucchero.
His composition is, however, praised
for decorum and suavity, his angels and female
countenances for beauty, and his colour for a
tone of nature:&mdash;their full display distinguished
that Circumcision at the Church <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">della
Piet&agrave;</span>, which Ribera, Giordano, and Solimene
placed among the masterpieces of Naples. Curia
left a close imitator in Ippolito Borghese,
of whom little is seen at home, where he seldom
resided, but the Assumption of Maria
at the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Monte della Piet&agrave;</span>,&mdash;an extensive work,
marked by equal vigour of execution.</p>

<p>Perino del Vaga, at Rome, instructed, and
was assisted by, two Neapolitans, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giovanni
Corso</span> and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gianfilippo Criscuolo</span>. The best that
remains of Corso at Naples, is a Christ bearing
his Cross, in S. Lorenzo. Long a pupil of
Sabbatini, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Criscuolo</span>, during the little time of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
stay at Rome, studied the works of Raffaello
with a perseverance which acquired him the
name of the Studious Neapolitan; but without
native vigour, timid, correct, and dry, he remained
fitter to teach than to lead. Such were
the principal followers of the Roman School
at Naples; for neither Francesco Imparato,
who abandoned the dry precepts of Criscuolo
for the genial example of Tiziano, nor his son
Girolamo, who long after followed the same
principles with more pretence and less success,
can properly be classed among the pupils of
Rome. About 1544<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> a Tuscan introduced at
Naples, what is as commonly as impertinently
called, the style of Michael Angiolo: a cold
enumeration of sesquipedalian muscles, groups
uninspired by thought, feeble in effect, and
crude or faint in colour, methodized by manner
and despatched by practice. Thus Giorgio
Vasari filled the Refectory of Monte Oliveto,
during one year of residence, with an enormous
work, which he considered as the electric
stroke that was to animate that indolent taste,
till then vainly solicited by Raffaello and his
school. Whether he disgusted the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
pride by such insolent civility, or provoked the
indignation of those who, in Andrea Sabbatini,
venerated a superior name, it appears that, so
far from creating a school, he was discountenanced
by the public, and incurred the perpetual
censure of every Neapolitan writer on
art. He ought to have known, that he who
challenges a nation, courts an eternal feud.</p>

<p>Another, less pompous, but more effectual
follower of Michael Angiolo, was Marco da
Pino, or Marco da Siena: the date<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> of his arrival
at Naples ought probably to be placed
after 1560. He was well received, presented
with the freedom of the city, and deserved the
courtesy by the amenity of his manners and
sincerity of character. With the reputation of
the first artist, Marco was employed in the
most conspicuous churches of the city and the
state. Though he sometimes repeated his
inventions, he approached Michael Angiolo
nearer than any other Tuscan, because he affected
less to do it. His forms are appealed
to by Lomazzo as instances of just proportion,
and, in keeping and a&euml;rial perspective, he is
ranked with Lionardo and Robusti. As his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
design is less charged, so is his colour more
vigorous and glowing than the usual tinge of
the Tuscan School: sometimes, however, he is
unequal, trusts to practice, and deviates into
manner. He was an able architect, and of the
good writers on that art.</p>

<p>Of many pupils reared in his school, none
was comparable to Gio. Angiolo Criscuolo, brother
of G. Filippo. Though bred a notary, he
had practised miniature from his youth; emulation
with his brother prompted him to attempt
larger proportions; and, under the tuition
of Marco, he became a good imitator of
his style.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>To dwell circumstantially on the crowd
of artists that fill the biographic pages of
this period, humiliating as mere nomenclature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
may appear, is below the dignity of an art,
which, like poetry, admits not of mediocrity.
Reputation during life, the partiality of friends
and countrymen, some single work which escaped
to excellence from the insignificant productions
of a long career, are but equivocal
claims on the homage of posterity: and more
legitimate ones in oil or fresco, have neither
Silvestro Bruno, Simone del Papa, the younger
Amato, Mazzolini, Cola dell' Amatrice, Pompeo
dell' Aquila, Giuseppe Valeriani, Marco
Mazzaroppi, Gio. Pietro Russo, Pietro Negrone
of Calabria, nor the Sicilian Gio. Borghese.
Pirro Ligorio, the favourite architect
of Pio IV. in Rome, and the engineer of Alphonso
II. at Ferrara, owes the preservation
of his name more to his Augean collections of
antiquarian lumber and the intrigues by which
he perplexed the last years of M. Angiolo,
than to the flimsy exertions of his pencil.</p>

<p>Matteo da Lecc&egrave;, of obscure education, displayed
in Rome a perverse attachment to the
manner of M. Angiolo by the usual conglobation
of muscles and extravagance of action.
He worked chiefly in fresco, and with a relief,
which, in the phrase of Baglioni, makes some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of his figures burst from the wall. Though
many Florentines were then at Rome, he alone
appeared capable of completing the plan of
Buonarroti, in the Sistina, by facing the Last
Judgement with the Fall of the Rebel Angels.
Matteo girt himself boldly for the work, and
left it a lamentable proof of the ridicule that
must attend the presumption of a mere craftsman
to ally himself with a man of genius. He
worked likewise in Malta and in Spain, and,
passing from thence to the Indies, became a
thriving trader, till duped by the rage of
digging for treasures, he dissipated his wealth,
and died of penury and grief.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>After the middle of the sixteenth century,
the flame-like rapidity of Tintoretto's style at
Venice, and soon after, the powerful contrast
of Caravaggio's method at Rome, and the
eclectic system of the Carracci, at Bologna,
spread general emulation over Italy, and divided
Naples into three parties, of nearly equal
strength, led by Corenzio, Ribera, and Caracciolo,
differing from each other, but ready to
unite against all foreign competition. During
their flourish, Guido, Domenichino, Lanfranco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Artemisia Gentileschi were at Naples, and
formed some pupils;&mdash;a period as enviable in
the number of excellent artists and the progressive
powers of execution, as disgraceful for
the dark man&#339;uvres and the vile intrigues
that fill it&mdash;intrigues and man&#339;uvres too closely
interwoven with the history of Neapolitan art,
and, unfortunately, too well attested, merely
to be dismissed with silence and contempt.</p>

<p>Belisario Corenzio,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> an Ach&aelig;an Greek, after
passing five years in the school of Tintoretto,
fixed his abode at Naples about 1590. A
native stream of ideas and unparalleled celerity
of hand placed him, perhaps, on a level with
his master in the dispatch of a prodigious number,
even of most extensive works; but his
rage was too ungovernable often to admit of
more distinguished comparisons with Robusti;
though few excelled him in design, and his
works abound in conceptions, attitudes, and
airs of heads confessedly inimitable to the Venetians
themselves. The work in which he
has best succeeded as an imitator of Tintoretto,
is the Miraculous Feeding of the Crowd by
the Saviour, in the Refectory of the Benedictines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
a huge performance, but, under his hands,
a task of forty days. Though generally too
much of a mannerist to sacrifice the readiest
to the best, he still preserves a character of his
own, an air of originality, in glories especially,
which he embosomed in darkness and clouds
pregnant with showers. With a decided turn
for works of large dimension in fresco, which
seldom allowed him to submit to the finish of oil
colour, he contrived to please by various compositions
of sacred history, in small proportions,
and is even said to have enlivened the
perspectives of the Frenchman Desiderio with
diminutive figures admirably toned and adapted
to the scenery.</p>

<p>The native country of Giuseppe Ribera<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
was a subject of dispute between the Spaniards
and Neapolitans, till the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
an extract from the baptismal register of Xativa
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Antologia di Roma</span>, 1795) decided the
claim in favour of Spain, and proved him a
native of that place, now "San Felipe," in the
district of Valencia. If the date of his birth,
January 12, 1588, be correct, he must have come
to Italy and entered the school of Caravaggio
at a very early period. From him Ribera went
to Rome, Modena, Parma, saw Raffaello, Annibale,
Correggio, and in imitation of their works
attempted to form a more luminous and gayer
style, in which he had little success, dismissed
it soon after his return to Naples, and once
more embraced the method of Caravaggio, as
more eminently calculated by its force, truth,
and effect to fix the eye of the multitude, the
object of his ambition; he soon became painter
to the court, and by degrees the arbiter of its
taste.</p>

<p>The studies he had pursued enabled him to
go beyond Caravaggio in invention, mellowness,
and design: the grand Deposition from the
Cross at the Certosa proves the success of his
emulation, a work, by the verdict of Giordano,
alone sufficient to form a painter: the Martyrdom
of S. Gennaro in the royal chapel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the S. Jerome of the Trinit&agrave;, excel his usual
style, and possess Titianesque beauties. S. Jerome
was among his darling subjects; S. Jerome
he painted, he etched in numerous repetition,
in whole-length and in half figures. He delighted
in the representation of hermits, anchorets,
apostles, prophets, perhaps less to impress
the mind with gravity of character and the venerable
looks of age, than to strike the eye
with the imitation of incidental deformities
attendant on decrepitude, and the picturesque
display of bone, veins, and tendons athwart
emaciated muscle. A shrivelled arm, a dropsied
leg, were to Ribera what a breast-plate
and a gaberdine were to Rembrandt. As in
objects of imitation he courted meagreness or
excrescence, so in the choice of historic subjects
he preferred to the terrors of ebullient
passions, features of horror or loathsomeness,
the spasms of Ixion, St. Bartholomew under
the butcher's knife. Nor are the few ideas of
gaiety by which he endeavoured to soothe his
exasperated fancy, less disgusting: Bacchus and
his attendants are grinning Lazaroni or bloated
wine-sacks; brutality under his hand distorts
the feature of mirth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Giambatista Caracciolo,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> first attached to
Franc. Imparato, then to Caravaggio, grew to
manhood before he had produced any work
of consequence: roused afterward by the fame
and the impression made on his mind by some
picture of Annibale, he went to Rome, and
by a pertinacious study of the Farnese Gallery
became one of the best imitators of that style.
This was the basis of his fame on his return to
Naples, and by this, whenever provoked to
competition, he maintained it: such are the
Madonna of S. Anna de' Lombardi; S. Carlo,
in the church of S. Agnello; and the Christ
under the Cross, at the Incurabili. The rest
of his performances, by their strength of chiaroscuro,
betray the school of Caravaggio. From
so considerate and finished an artist, haste and
flimsiness were not to be feared, and yet there
exist productions of his so feeble that his biographer<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
is reduced to account for them from
the artist's wish of retaliating by paltry work
for paltrier prices; or from suffering them to
be finished by Mercurio d'Aversa, no very
estimable pupil.</p>

<p>Such were the three leaders of that cabal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
which for some years persecuted every stranger
of eminence in the art who freely came, or was
invited to come, to Naples. Reputation, fiction,
violence, had raised Belisario to the tyranny of
fresco; the most lucrative commissions he considered
as due to himself, the rest he distributed
among his dependants, the greater number
of whom possessed little merit. Massimo
Santafede, though independent of him, remained
neuter, afraid to interfere with a man who,
to obtain his purpose, would stop at neither
fraud nor crime; a proof of which he is said to
have given, in administering poison to the gentlest
and best of his pupils, Luigi Roderigo,
whose growing powers he envied.</p>

<p>To maintain his primacy in fresco, the exclusion
of every stranger who excelled in that
branch became, of course, his principal object.
Annibale Caracci arrived at Naples in 1609, to
paint the churches "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">dello Spirito Santo</span>" and
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">di Gesu Nuovo</span>," and produced a small picture
as a specimen of his style. The Greek
and his associates, called upon to give their
opinion of it, unanimously condemned it as
cold, and its master far too tame to manage an
extensive work. Thus baffled, Annibale returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to Rome during the most oppressive
heats of summer, and soon after died. But
the work most contested with strangers was the
royal chapel of S. Gennaro, which the deputies
had reserved for Giuseppe d'Arpino, then painting
the choir of the Certosa. Belisario, leaguing
himself with Spagnoletto, not less fierce and
arrogant, and with Caracciolo, who both aspired
to that commission, attacked Cesari with a
fury which forced him, before he could terminate
his choir, to fly for safety, first to Monte
Cassino, and then back to Rome. The commission
was now given to Guido; but not long
after, two men unknown cudgelled his servant
and dismissed him with a message to his master
immediately to depart or to prepare for death.
Guido fled; but Gessi his pupil, not intimidated,
having demanded and obtained the
grand commission, repaired to Naples with two
assistants, G. Batista Ruggieri and Lorenzo Menini;
both were decoyed on board a galley, that
immediately slipped its cable and transported
them to some place which no researches could
discover, and Gessi was obliged to return with
his disappointment to Rome.</p>

<p>Dispirited by the violence of these man&#339;uvres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the deputies began to give way to
the cabal of the monopolists, allotting the frescoes
to Correnzio and Caracciolo, and flattering
Spagnoletto with the hope of being intrusted
with the altar-pieces; when all at once, repenting
of their agreement, they ordered the two
fresco painters to throw up their work, and
transferred the whole of the chapel to Domenichino,
at the splendid price of a hundred
ducats for every entire, fifty for each half
figure, and twenty-five for every head.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> They
likewise took measures for his personal safety, by
obtaining the Viceroy's protection, but in vain.
The faction, not content with crying him down
as a cold insipid painter and discrediting him
with those who see with their ears and fill
every place, alarmed him with anonymous letters,
threw down what he had painted, mixed
ashes with his materials to crack the ground
he had prepared, and, by a stroke of the most
refined malice, persuaded the Viceroy to give
him a commission of some pictures for the
Court of Spain. These, when little more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
dead-coloured, they carried from his study to
court, where Ribera superciliously ordered
what alterations he thought proper, and then,
without allowing him leisure to terminate the
whole, dispatched them to Spain. The insolence
of the rival, the complaints of the deputies
on the successive interruptions of their
work, and hence the suspicion of mischief, induced
Domenichino at last secretly to depart
for Rome, in hopes of being able from thence
to bring his affairs into a better train,&mdash;and
not without success; the rumours of his flight
subsided, new measures for his safety were
taken, he returned to Naples, and, without
more interruption, completed the greater part
of the frescoes, and considerably advanced the
altar-pieces.</p>

<p>Here death surprised him, accelerated, as
some have suspected, by poison, certainly by
repeated causes of disgust from his relations,
competitors, and, above all, the arrival of his
old adversary Lanfranco. He succeeded to
Domenichino in the remaining fresco, Spagnoletto
in one of the oil pictures, and Stanzioni
in another. Caracciolo was dead; Belisario,
excluded by age from sharing in the spoil, soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
after was destroyed by a ruinous fall from a
scaffold. Nor had Ribera, if the prevailing
fame be true,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> a desirable end; dishonoured
in his daughter, gnawed by remorse for the
vile persecutions in which he had shared,
odious to himself, and sick of light, he escaped
to sea, and none tells where he perished.</p>

<p>Opposed at its onset by these three, the
School of Bologna triumphed after their demise,
and Naples was divided into its imitators;
for the mannered style of Cesari, which
approached that of Belisario, terminated with
Luigi Roderigo, and his relative Gian Bernardino.</p>

<p>At the head of those who adopted Caracciesque
principles with success, may be placed
Massimo Stanzioni<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> a scholar of Caracciolo, and,
as he himself asserts, of Lanfranco in fresco, in
portrait of Santafede. At Rome he strove to
embody the forms of Annibale with the tints
of Guido. Thus equipped, he braved the foremost
talents at Naples, and opposed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Certosa a Dead Christ among the Maries to
Spagnoletto, who, to escape comparisons, persuaded
the friars to have the picture of his
rival washed to recover its somewhat darkened
tone, and with a corrosive liquor so defaced it,
that Stanzioni, declaring so black a fraud ought
to remain an object of public indignation,
refused to retouch it; he left, however, other
specimens of his powers at that repository of
rival talents, and above all the masterpiece of
S. Bruno. The ceilings of Gesu Nuovo and
of S. Paolo give him a distinguished rank
among fresco painters. His gallery pictures,
though not rare at Naples, are seldom met with
elsewhere. Whilst single, he sought and aimed
at excellence, and courted the art for its own
sake; after his marriage, with a woman of
fashion, gain became necessary to maintain her
in a state of splendour, and he sunk by degrees
to mediocrity.</p>

<p>The School of Massimo is celebrated for the
number and excellence of its pupils, but the
two who promised most, Muzio Rossi and Antonio
de Bellis, perished in the bloom of life.
The first, who had entered the School of Guido
at Bologna, was at the age of eighteen thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
worthy to face at the Certosa men of the first
ability, and shrinks from no comparison, but
scarcely survived his work. The second, whose
style is nearly balanced between Guido and
Guercino, began at the church of S. Carlo various
pictures from the life of that Saint, which
he lived not to finish.</p>

<p>Francesco di Rosa, called Pacicco, another
pupil of that school, gave himself up to the
imitation of Guido, by Massimo's own advice.
Pacicco is one of the few artists mentioned by
Paolo de Matteio in a MS. which admits no
name of mediocrity. His forms, his colour,
the elegance of his extremities, the grace and
dignity of his characters, are equally commended.
He had models of beauty in three nieces,
one of whom, Aniella di Rosa, in charms, talents,
and manner of death has been compared
to Elizabeth Sirani: poison, administered by
the malignity of strangers, swept the Bolognese&mdash;a
dagger and a husband's jealousy, the
Neapolitan: he was Agostin Beltrano, her fellow
pupil, and frequent partner of her works.</p>

<p>The remaining scholars of this school, Paul
Domenico Finoglia, Giacinto de' Popoli, and
Giuseppe Marullo, all three of Orta,&mdash;Andrea
Malinconico, and Bernardo Cavallino, were, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
we except the last, with more or less felicity,
imitators of their master. Cavallino, more original,
is said to have provoked the jealousy
of Massimo, who advised him to paint in small:
this ought to be admitted with hesitation, for
it is difficult to believe, that he who feels himself
made for the grand, could be persuaded to
waste his life on trifles.</p>

<p>Another convert to the Caracci School, was
Andrea Vaccaro,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the friend and competitor of
Massimo, a man made for imitation, says Lanzi,
and says too much; for, if he had no equal
in that of Caravaggio, he was, when imitating
Guido, inferior to Massimo: nor did he, till
after the demise of Stanzioni, acquire that supremacy
at Naples which remained undisputed
till the arrival of Giordano, young, vigorous,
and fraught with the novel style of Pietro Beretini.
Both concurred for the great altar-piece
of S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria del Pianto, both presented their
sketches, and Vaccaro obtained preference by
the verdict of Pietro da Cortona himself, who
declared him equally superior in experience
and correctness of style to his own scholar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
but, when contending with Giordano in fresco,
to which he had not been trained by early practice,
Vaccaro lost the honours he had gained.
The best of his school was Giacomo Farelli,
whom Luca found no contemptible antagonist:
had he been content to follow the style of his
master, without aspiring at that of Domenichino,
for which he was unfit, he might have
deserved the historian's notice for more than
one picture.</p>

<p>On the School of Domenichino, the Sicilians,
Pietro, Giacomo, and Teresa del Po, cannot
confer much honour. The father had more
theory than practice, the son less evidence than
ostentation, the daughter shone in miniature.
Nearer to the master, both in style and temper,
was Francesco di Maria: correct, slow, irresolute,
author of few but eminent works, especially
the subjects relative to S. Lawrence, at
the Conventuals of Naples. He excelled in
portraits, one of which, exhibited at Rome with
one of Vandyk and another by Rubens, was,
by Poussin, Cortona, and Sacchi, preferred to
both. He often has been mistaken for his master,
and commands high prices: the want of
grace alone betrays him&mdash;of grace Nature had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
not been liberal to Francesco. Hence he became
the proverb of Giordano, "that sickening
over bone and muscle, he rendered beauty
tame." He, in retort, held up Giordano's style
as heresy in art, a flowery medley of incoherent
charms.</p>

<p>Though the reputed master, Lanfranco was
not the model of Massimo; his principal imitator
was Giambatista Benaschi, or Bernaschi,
numbered with Roman artists by Orlandi, but
who fixed his residence at Naples, and opened
a numerous school; a decided machinist, but
with a grasp of fancy which never suffered him
to repeat a figure in the same attitude. His
points of sight from below upward, are correct,
and his foreshortenings dextrously contrived.
None ever approached a master nearer, and forsook
him with less success.</p>

<p>Guercino never saw Naples, but Mattia Preti,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
commonly called Calabrese, smit with his
novel style, went to study it at Cento; not indeed
exclusively, for no Italian school escaped
the attention of Preti. Unpractised in colour
to his twenty-sixth year, he attended solely to
design, less to form beauty or trace characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of delicacy, than to express robust and energetic
ones: in such he often succeeded, but
sometimes sunk to heaviness. His colour resembled
his line, not soft and airy, but dense,
cut into masses of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaroscuro</span>, and with a general
tone of ashy hues, tints of sorrow, contrition,
anguish, the favourite topics of his
pencil. The frescoes of Calabrese at Modena,
Naples, Malta, have a stamp of grandeur. At
Rome, in S. Andrea della Valle, he appears
to less advantage, too enormous for the place,
and too ponderous at the side of Domenichino.
Italy is filled with his oil pictures, for his life
was long, his hand rapid, and every place he
visited, a scene of exercise: what he painted
for galleries consisted commonly of half figures,
like those of Guercino. He long, and nearly
alone, contested the field with Giordano, to
whose captivating airiness his weight was at
last forced to yield. He retired and died in
Malta, a Knight of its order, without leaving a
pupil who rose above mediocrity.</p>

<p>After this survey of the Bolognese School
at Naples, the native one of Ribera claims attention.
None ever swore more implicitly to
a master's dictates: the energy of his style absorbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
their eye, the atrocity of his character
too often debauched their hearts. Inferiority
alone discriminates the works of Giovanni
Do and Bartolommeo Passante from those of
Spagnoletto; though, in the advance of life,
the first attempted to tinge with less vulgarity,
and the second now and then affected a more
select outline. Francesco Fracanzani had a
certain grandeur of execution and bloom of
colour: his "Transito," or Death of St. Joseph,
at the Pellegrini, is among the first pictures of
the city. But, by the pressure of poverty, he
first became a dauber, then a criminal, and received
sentence of death, which respect for his
profession, from the public ignominy of the
halter, mitigated to secret execution by poison.</p>

<p>Aniello Falcone<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and Salvator Rosa, who is
to be mentioned more at large elsewhere, are
the greatest boast of this school, though Rosa
frequented it for a short time only, and chiefly
profited by the instruction of Falcone. The
strength of Falcone lay in battles, which he
painted in all dimensions, from the Sacred
books, history, or poems. Countenance, arms,
dresses were in unison with the national character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
of the combatants. His expression was
vivid, the figures and movements of his horses
select and natural, and his tactics correct,
though he had neither served in, nor seen a
battle. He drew with precision, everywhere
consulted the life, and laid his colour on with
equal strength and finish. That he instructed
Borgognone is not probable. Baldinucci, who
published the Memoirs of that Jesuit, is silent
on that head; but they knew and esteemed
each other. He had a numerous set of scholars,
and with them, and the assistance of some
other painters, contrived to revenge the murder
of some relative and of a pupil assassinated by
the presidial Spaniards: for, at the revolutionary
hubbub of Maso Aniello, he and his gang
formed themselves into a troop, which they
called "the Company of Death," and, protected
by Ribera, who palliated their proceedings at
court, spread horrid massacre, till, scared by
the return of order, this band of homicides dispersed,
and sought their safety in flight. Falcone
himself retired for some years to France,
which has many of his works; the rest escaped
to Rome, or sought the usual asylums of revenge
and murder.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>
<p>A numerous set of various but inferior artists,
in power and pursuit, fills the remaining
period of this epoch and the Neapolitan catalogues
of art: the best of these issued from
the desperate School of Falcone, to whose method
they adhered in all their diverging branches.
Of these Domenico Gargiuoli, nicknamed Micco
Spadaro, a character as fierce as pliant, leads the
van&mdash;no contemptible figurist in large, but of
endless combination in groups of small proportion.
The perspectives of Viviano Codagora,
his sworn brother, receive an exclusive
lustre from his figures. The battles of their
fellow scholar, Carlo Coppola, might sometimes
be mistaken for those of Falcone, had he given
less fulness to his horses. Paolo Porpora left
battles to paint quadrupeds, but chiefly and
best, fish and sea-shells: in fruit and flowers he
was far surpassed by Abraham Brueghel, who
at that time had settled at Naples. Giuseppe
Recco and Andrea Belvedere, from the same
school, excelled in game and birds; and the
last still more in flowers and fruit, so as to contest
superiority in that branch with Giordano,
asserting that no figurist could reach the polish,
or give the finish required in minute objects.
Luca maintained, that the more implies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
less, and, composing a picture of game, fruit,
and flowers, gave it such an air of illusion,
that Andrea, shrinking from his presence crestfallen,
retired among the literati of the day,
of whom he was not the least.</p>

<p>After the middle of the seventeenth century,
the revolutionary style of Luca Giordano<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> reversed
every preceding principle, and, by the
suavity of its ornamental magic, enchanted the
public taste. A vast, resolute, creative, talent
attended him from infancy: in his eighth year
he is said to have painted, and not for the first
time in fresco, two infant angels, for the church
of S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria La Nuova.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Struck with wonder,
the Vice R&egrave; Duke Medina de Las Torres
placed him with Ribera, whose principles he
studied for some time, but, aspiring to a more
ample theatre of art, escaped to Rome, followed
by his father, Antonio, a weak artist, but
an unceasing monitor, and the more relentless
because he placed all his hopes on the rapid
success of his son. To insure it, he did not, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
we believe one writer, suffer Luca to intermit
his labours by regular meals, but fed him whilst
at work, as birds their callow young, perpetually
chirping into his ear, Luca, dispatch!<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>&mdash;Luca,
dispatch! repeated his fellow-students,
till the joke became nickname, by which he
is oftener distinguished than by his own.</p>

<p>So brutal a method would have excited in a
mind less vigorous nothing but weariness and
despondency, but to the combining spirit of
Luca gave with portentous velocity of hand
the rudiments of that varied power, which, to a
degree of deception, taught him to imitate the
predominant air of every master's style in line
and colour, which he was set or chose to copy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
and he had in nearly endless repetition, copied
the best of what Rome possessed of its own,
the Lombard, Venetian, and foreign schools,
when he entered that of Pietro da Cortona,
whose wide-extended and ostentatious plans
met most congenially his own.</p>

<p>No single master's manner did he, however,
exclusively adopt. His first works exhibit the
pupil of Ribera, with evident aims at the energy
of that style; his subsequent and best
manner is marked by the beauties and the faults
of Pietro da Cortona, the same contrast of composition,
the same masses of light, with equal
monotony of expression, which in female features
was often supplied by his wife; a predilection
for the ornamental splendour of Paolo
Veronese distinguishes with less advantage a
third class of his works&mdash;in this, stuffs are
mixed with draperies, the tints are less vigorous,
the chiaroscuro less decided, the execution
heavier. It has been observed, that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
works, when compared with the finished masterpieces
of the classic schools, are little better
than embryos, that he carried nothing to perfection,
and that the delusive power alone,
by which he united a number of jarring parts
in one pleasing whole, can save him from sinking
to the mediocrity which overwhelmed his
imitators. But it ought likewise to be considered,
what was the object of his exertions, and
the end which he pursued;&mdash;they were, by conquering
the eye, to become the favourite of
the public, and he was made for both. Others
see by degrees, arrange, reject, select;&mdash;into the
fancy of Giordano, the subject with its parts
showered at once; the picture stood complete
before him. In colour, little solicitous about
the dictates of art, or the real hues of Nature,
he created an ideal and arbitrary tone, which
represented the air of things without diving
into their substance, and, content with absolute
dominion over the eye, left it to others to
inform the mind. If his method was compendiary;
none ever knew better how to improve
an accident to a beauty, and give to the random
strokes of haste the look of deliberate practice.
That he knew the laws of design, we know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
but debauched by facility and the rage of gain,
neglected the toil of correctness: hence likewise
the superficial manner in which he often
laid on his colours, diluted, unembodied, and
unable to retain the fugitive imagery of his
pencil.</p>

<p>Naples is full of Giordano&mdash;few, if any in so
vast a metropolis, are the churches that want
his hand. In that of the P.P. Girolamini, the
Expulsion of the Venders is one of his most
admired works; but the best of his frescoes, in
which he seems to have concentrated his powers,
are those in the treasury of the Certosa.
The cupola of S. Brigida, rapidly painted in
competition with Francesco di Maria, exhibits
the first specimens of that flattering tone which
baffled the learning of his rival, intoxicated
the vulgar, and corrupted the growing taste.
The admired picture of St. Xavier, of copious
composition and the most seductive colour, was
the work of one day and a half. Among the
public and private paintings at Florence, the
chapel Corsini and the gallery Riccardi are by
the hand of Luca; nor was he unemployed by
the Sovereign; and Cosmo III., in whose presence
he invented and coloured a large composition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
with momentary velocity, declared
him a painter formed for princes. He obtained
the same praise from Charles II. of Spain, whom
he served for thirteen years, but from the multitude
of his works might be supposed to have
served during a long life. There he continued
the series of pictures begun by Cambiasi, in the
church of the Escurial, on the most extensive
plan, but inferior in style and execution
to the frescoes of Buon-Ritiro. Of his oil
pictures, that of the Nativity, for the Queen
Mother, has shared unlimited praise, as combining
with superior felicity of execution, a
research and a depth of study seldom found
in his other works.</p>

<p>Grown old, he returned to Naples, loaded
with riches and honours, and soon after died,
regretted as the first painter of his time.</p>

<p>Though Giordano did not propose his process
as a model of imitation to his scholars, it
may easily be guessed that his success made
a deeper impression on them than his precepts,
and that without previously submitting to the
labours of his education, they attempted to
snatch with the charms the profits of his manner.
Hence a swarm of bold craftsmen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
mannerists was let loose upon the public, who
with gay mediocrity overwhelmed what yet
was left of principles in art. Of these, his
favourites were Aniello Rossi, and Matteo
Pacelli, who accompanied him to Spain, returned
well pensioned, and continued to live
in obscure ease. Niccolo Rossi, Giuseppe
Simonelli, Andrea Miglionico and Ramondo
de Dominici, came nearer their master; and
the Spaniard Franceschitto, as he had raised
the hopes, might have excited the jealousy of
Luca, had he not been intercepted by death.
He left a specimen of his powers in the picture
of S. Pasquale, at S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria del Monte.</p>

<p>But the best of his pupils, and heir of his
dispatch, was Paolo de' Matteis, a name that
ranks with the foremost of that day, not unknown
to France or Rome; his chief abode
was, however, Naples, where his frescoes are
spread over churches, galleries, halls and ceilings;
if unequal to those of his master in
merit, nearly always produced with equal speed.
It was his unexampled vaunt to have painted
the enormous Cupola del Ges&ugrave; Nuovo in sixty-six
days, a boast which Solimene checked with
the cool reply, that the work told its own tale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
without assistance: and yet it possesses beauties,
especially in the parts that imitate Lanfranco,
which excite wonder, considering the
fury of execution. Nor, if he chose to work
with previous study and with diligence, as in
the church of the '<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pii Operai</span>,' in the gallery
Matatona, and in many private pictures, was
he destitute of composition, grace of outline,
or beauty of countenance, though little varied.
His colour at the onset was Giordanesque; in
the sequel he increased the force of his <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaroscuro</span>,
though not without delicate gradation
of tints: particularly in Madonnas and Infants,
which give an idea of Albano's suavity, and
the Roman style. A school more numerous
than distinguished by talent, contributes little
to his celebrity.</p>

<p>Francesco Solimene,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> called "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">L'Abate Ciccio</span>,"
born at Nocera de' Pagani, took the elements
of art from his father Angelo, formerly a pupil
of Massimo, and went to Naples. He successively
frequented the schools of Francesco di
Maria and of Giac. del Po, and left both to
follow his own inclination, which at first exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
led him to imitate the style of Pietro
da Cortona, and even to adopt his figures. He
next formed a manner which, of all others, approached
next to Preti; the design, indeed, is
less exact, the colour less true, but the faces
handsomer, now in imitation of Guido, then
nearer to Maratta, and often picked from life:
hence the byname of "the Gentler Calabrese."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
To Preti he joined Lanfranco, whom he surnamed
the "Master," and from him borrowed
and exaggerated that serpentine sweep of composition:
his chiaroscuro, balanced between
both, lost some of its vigour and became softer
with the advance of life. He drew and revised
his forms from Nature with much accuracy
before he painted, but often sacrificed
his outline to the fire of execution in the process.
The facility and elegance which distinguish
him in poetry, mark his invention
in painting, to no branch of which he could
be called a stranger, and might have excelled
singly in each. His works are scattered over
Europe, for he lived to the age of ninety, and
yielded in velocity of hand to Giordano only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
his competitor and friend, at whose demise he
succeeded to the Primacy of taste.</p>

<p>Of the public works that most distinguish
Solimene, are the stories of the sacristy in S.
Paolo Maggiore de' P.P. Teatini, nor less the
pictures substituted for those of Giacomo del
Po on the arches of the Chapels in the Church
de' S.S. Apostoli. Specimens of his high
finish may be seen in the Chapel of S. Filippo
in the Church dell' Oratorio; he painted the
principal altar-piece of the Nuns di "S. Gaudioso,"
and the four large histories in the choir
of the church at Monte Cassino. Of private
works, the gallery of Sanfelice is the most conspicuous
at Naples; at Rome, some stories in
the Albani and Colonna palaces; and at Macerata,
in the Buonacorsi collection, among several
mythologic subjects, the Death of Dido, a
picture of large dimensions and striking effect.
In the refectory of the Conventuals of Assisi,
the Last Supper of our Lord, a polished performance,
is by his hand.</p>

<p>Of that most numerous band of pupils whom
he let loose upon the public, the most celebrated
was, no doubt, Sebastiano Conca, a
native of Gaeta, generally classed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Roman school, for Rome became his residence
and the theatre of his talent. After having
served a pupilage of sixteen years under Solimene,
and persevered in the practice of that
style for several years at Rome, he ominously
proved the futility of attempting at an advanced
period to escape from the tyranny of
early habits. At forty he dared to leave his
brushes, became once more a student, and spent
five years in drawing after the antique and the
masters of design: but his hand and eye, debauched
by manner, refused to obey his mind,
till, wearied by hopeless fatigue, he followed
the advice of the sculptor Le Gros, and returned
to his former practice, though not without considerable
improvements, and nearer to Pietro da
Cortona than to his master. Conca had fertile
brains, a rapid pencil, and a colour which at
first sight fascinated every eye by its splendour,
contrast, and the delicacy of its flesh-tints. His
dispatch in fresco and in oil was equal to his
employment, and there is scarcely a collection
of any consequence without its Conca. He
was courted by sovereigns and princes, and
Pope Clement XI. ennobled him at a full
assembly of the academicians of St. Luke. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
was assisted in his labours by his brother Giovanni,
a man of similar taste, but less power,
and an excellent copyist. The maxims of
Conca are considered<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> as having completed
the ruin of art; but every school had its own
canker, and his influence did not extend to all.
Without deviating into a catalogue of mediocrity,
it may be sufficient to name three of his
principal scholars, Gaetano Lapis of Cagli, Salvator
Monosilio, a Messinese, and Gaspero
Serenari, a Palermitan. Lapis had too much
originality of conception and too much solidity
of taste to adopt the flowery style of his master.
The public works he left at home, and
the Birth of Venus in a ceiling of the Borghese
Palace, as correct as graceful, deserved and
would have attained more celebrity, had not
self-contempt and diffidence intercepted the
fortune which his talent might have commanded.
The two Sicilians, complete machinists,
shared with the imitation the success of their
master.</p>

<p>Next to Conca, the most successful pupil of
Solimene was Francesco de Mura, surnamed
Franceschiello, born at Naples and greatly
employed in its churches and private galleries:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the works, however, to which he owes most of
his celebrity, were the frescoes painted in various
apartments of the royal palace at Torino,
in competition with Claudio Beaumont, who
was then at the height of his vigour. Mura
ornamented the ceiling of some rooms, chiefly
filled with Flemish pictures, with subjects
widely different, Olympic games, and actions
of Achilles.</p>

<p class="p2b">Corrado Giaquinto of Molfetta, may conclude
what yet deserves to be recorded of this
school. He too left Naples, came to Rome,
and attached himself to Conca, whose maxims
he made nearly all his own; as resolute, as
easy, but less correct. Rome, Macerata, and
other parts of the Roman state, are acquainted
with his works. He painted in Piemont, was
employed by Charles III. in Spain, appointed
Director of the Academy of S. Fernando,
pleased and continued to please the greater
part of the public, even after the arrival of
A.R. Mengs.</p>

was in possession of oil painting, how is the astonishment
to be accounted for, which the method of John ab Eyk
excited at Naples? How came the name of an obscure
Fleming to fill in a short period all Europe, every prince to
solicit his pencil, every painter to submit to his dictates or
those of his scholars? Who, on the contrary, who out of
Naples or its state, knew then Colantonio? who courted
Solario? a man so apt, the son-in-law and scholar of the
former, and before of Lippo Dalmasio&mdash;how forgot he to
learn, or why did he neglect a method they are said to

Either they knew nothing of the mystery at all, or in a degree
too insignificant to affect the authority of Vasari, and
the claims of John ab Eyk and Antoniello.</p></div>

Art. The transient manner in which Vasari had mentioned
Marco in the new edition of his Lives, his silence on

of Marco. His pupil, the Notary, furnished him with

<p class="lecture">THE SCHOOL OF VENICE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> conquests, commerce and possessions of
Venice in the Levant, and thence its uninterrupted
intercourse with the Greeks, give probability
to the conjecture, that Venetian art drew
its origin from the same source, and that the first
institution of a company, or, as it is there called,
a School (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Schola</span>) of Painters, may be dated up
to the Greek artists who took refuge at Venice
from the fury of the Iconoclasts at Constantinople.
The choice of its Patron, which was not
St. Luke, but S<sup>ta</sup>. Sophia, the patroness of the
first temple at that time, and prototype of St.
Mark's, distinguishes it from the rest of the
Italian Schools. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Anchona</i>, the vulgar name
of a picture in the technic language, the statutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
and documents of those times, is evidently
a depravation of the Greek <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Eikon</i>. The
school itself is of considerable antiquity; its
archives contain regulations and laws made in
1290, which refer to anterior ones; and though
not yet separated from the mass of artisans, its
members began to enjoy privileges of their own.</p>

<p>In various cities of the Venetian State we
meet with vestiges of art anterior in date<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> to the
relics of painting and mosaic in the metropolis,
which prove that it survived the general wreck
of society here, as in other parts of Italy. Of
the oldest Venetian monuments, Zanetti has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
given a detailed account, with shrewd critical
conjectures on their chronology; though all
attempts to discriminate the nearly imperceptible
progress of art in a mass of works equally
marked by dull servility, must prove little better
than nugatory; for it does not appear that
Theophilus of Byzantium, who publicly taught
the art at Venice about 1200, or his Scholar
Gelasio<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, had availed themselves of the improvements
made in form, twenty years before, by
Joachim the Abbot, in a picture of Christ. Nor
can the notice of Vasari, who informs us that
Andrea Tafi repaired to Venice to profit by
the instructions of Apollonios in mosaic, prove
more than that, from the rivalship of Greek
mechanics, that branch of art was handled with
greater dexterity there than at Florence, to
which place he was, on his return, accompanied
by Apollonios. The same torpor of mind continued
to characterise the succeeding artists till
the first years of the fourteenth century, and
the appearance of Giotto, who, on his return
from Avignon 1316, by his labours at Padua,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Verona, and elsewhere in the state, threw the
first effectual seeds of art, and gave the first
impulse to Venetian energy and emulation<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> by
superior example.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by Giusto, surnamed of
Padova, from residence and city rights, but
else a Florentine and of the Menabuoi. To
Padovano, Vasari ascribes the vast work of the
church of St. John the Baptist; incidents of
whose life were expressed on the altar-piece.
The walls Giusto spread with gospel history
and mysteries of the Apocalypse, and on the
Cupola a glory filled with a consistory of saints
in various attire: simple ideas, but executed
with incredible felicity and diligence. The
names 'Joannes &amp; Antonius de Padova,' formerly
placed over one of the doors, as an
ancient MS. pretends, related probably to some
companions of Giusto, fellow pupils of Giotto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and show the unmixed prevalence of his style,
to which Florence itself had not adhered with
more scrupulous submission, beyond the middle
of the century, and the less bigoted imitation of
Guarsiento, a Padovan of great name at that
period, and the leader of Ridolfi's history. He
received commissions of importance from the
Venetian senate, and the remains of his labours
in fresco and on panel at Bassano and at the
Eremitani of Padova, confirm the judgment
of Zanetti, that he had invention, spirit, and
taste, and without those remnants of Greek
barbarity which that critic pretends to discover
in his style.</p>

<p>Of a style still less dependant on the principles
of Giotto, are the relicks of those artists
whom Lanzi is willing to consider as the precursors
of the legitimate Venetian schools, and
whose origin he dates in the professors of miniature
and missal-painting, many contemporary,
many anterior to Giotto. The most conspicuous
is Niccolo Semitecolo, undoubtedly a Venetian,
if the inscription on a picture on panel in the
Capitular Library at Padova be genuine, viz.,
<i>Nicoleto Semitecolo da Venezia</i>, 1367. It represents
a Piet&agrave;, with some stories of S. Sebastian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
in no contemptible style: the nudities
are well painted, the proportions, though somewhat
too long, are not inelegant, and what adds
most to its value as a monument of national
style, it bears no resemblance to that of Giotto,
which, though it be inferior in design, it equals
in colour. Indeed the silence of Baldinucci,
who annexes no Venetian branch to his Tuscan
pedigree of Art, gives probability to the presumption,
that a native school existed in the
Adriatic long before Cimabue.</p>

<p>A fuller display of this native style, and its
gradual approaches to the epoch of Giorgione
and Tizian, were reserved for the fifteenth century:
an island prepared what was to receive
its finish at Venice. Andrea da Murano, who
flourished about 1400, though still dry, formal,
and vulgar, designs with considerable correctness,
even the extremities, and what is more,
makes his figures stand and act. There is still
of him at Murano in S. Pier Martire, a picture,
on the usual gold ground of the times, representing,
among others, a Saint Sebastian, with
a Torso, whose beauty made Zanetti suspect
that it had been copied from some antique statue.
It was he who formed to art the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
of the Vivarini, his fellow-citizens, who in uninterrupted
succession maintained the school of
Murano for nearly a century, and filled Venice
with their performances.</p>

<p>Of Luigi, the reputed founder of the family,
no authentic notices remain. The only picture
ascribed to him, in S. Giovanni and Paolo, has,
with the inscription of his name and the date
1414, been retouched.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Nor does much more
evidence attend the names of Giovanni and Antonio
de' Vivarini, the first of which belonged
probably to a German, the partner of Antonio,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
who is not heard of after 1447, whilst Antonio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
singly or in society with his brother Bartolommeo
Vivarini, left works inscribed with his
name as far as 1451.</p>

<p>Bartolommeo, probably considerably younger
than Antonio, was trained to art in the principles
before mentioned, till he made himself
master of the new-discovered method of oil-painting,
and towards the time of the two Bellini
became an artist of considerable note. His
first picture in oil bears the date of 1473; his
last, at S. Giovanni in Bragora, on the authority
of Boschini, that of 1498; it represents
Christ risen from the grave, and is a picture
comparable to the best productions of its time.
He sometimes added A Linnel Vivarino to his
name and date, allusive to his surname.</p>

<p>With him flourished Luigi, the last of the
Vivarini, but the first in art. His relics still
exist at Venice, Belluno, Trevigi, with their
dates; the principal of these is in the school of
St. Girolamo at Venice, where, in competition
with Giovanni Bellini, whom he equals, and
with Vittore Carpaccia, whom he surpasses, he
represented the Saint caressing a Lion, and some
monks who fly in terror at the sight. Composition,
expression, colour, for felicity, energy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
and mellowness, if not above every work of the
times, surpass all else produced by the family
of the Vivarini.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the century, Gentile da
Fabriano, styled Magister Magistrorum, and
mentioned in the Roman School, painted, in the
public palace at Venice, a naval battle, now
vanished, but then so highly valued that it procured
him an annual provision, and the privilege
of the Patrician dress. He raised disciples
in the state: Jacopo Nerito, of Padova, subscribes
himself a disciple of Gentile, in a picture at S.
Michele of that place, and from the style of
another in S. Bernardino, at Bassano, Lanzi
surmises that Nasocchio di Bassano was his
pupil or imitator. But what gives him most
importance, is the origin of the great Venetian
School under his auspices, and that Jacopo Bellini,
the father of Gentile and Giovanni, owned
him for his master. Jacopo is indeed more
known by the dignity of his son's than his own
works, at present either destroyed, in ruins, or
unknown. What he painted in the church of
St. Giovanni at Venice, and, about 1456, at the
Santo of Padova, the chapel of the family Gattamelata,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
are works that exist in history only.
One single picture, subscribed by his name,
Lanzi mentions to have seen in a private collection,
resembling the style of Squarcione, whom
he seems to have followed in his maturer years.</p>

<p>A name then still more conspicuous, though
now nearly obliterated, is that of Jacopo, or
as he is styled Jacobello, or as he wrote
himself, Jacometto del Fiore, whose father
Francesco del Fiore, a leader of art in his
day, was honoured with a monument and
an epitaph in Latin verse at S. Giovanni
and Paolo: of him it is doubtful whether
any traces remain, but of the son, who greatly
surpassed him, several performances still exist,
from 1401 to 1436. Vasari has wantonly
taxed him with having suspended all his
figures, in the Greek manner, on the points of
their feet: the truth is, that he was equalled
by few of his contemporaries, for few like him
dared to represent figures as large as life, and
fewer understood to give them beauty, dignity,
and that air of agility and ease, which his
forms possess; nor would the lions in his picture
of Justice at the Magistrato del Proprio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
have shared the first praise, had not the principal
figures, in subservience to the time, been
loaded with tinsel ornament and golden glitter.</p>

<p>Two scholars of his are mentioned: Donato,
superior to him in style, and Carlo Crivelli, of
obscure fame, but deserving attention for the
colour, union, grace, and expression, of the
small histories in which he delighted.</p>

<p>The ardour of the capital for the art was
emulated by every town of the state; all had
their painters, but all did not submit to the
principles of Venice and Murano. At Verona
the obscure names of Aldighieri and Stefano
Dazevio, were succeeded<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> by the vaunted one
of Vittore Pisanello, of S. Vito: though accounts
grossly vary on the date in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
flourished, and the school from which he
sprang, that his education was Florentine is
not improbable, but whoever his master, fame
has ranked him with Masaccio as an improver
of style. His works at Rome and Venice, in
decay at the time of Vasari, are now no more;
and fragments only remain of what he did at
Verona. S. Eustachio caressing a Dog, and
S. Giorgio sheathing his Sword and mounting
his horse, figures extolled to the skies by
Vasari, are, with the places which they occupied,
destroyed: works which seem to have
contained elements of truth and dignity in
expression with novelty of invention, and of
contrast, style, and foreshortening in design:
a loss so much the more to be lamented, as the
remains of his less considerable works at S.
Firmo and Perugia, far from sanctioning the
opinion which tradition has taught us to entertain
of Pisano, are finished indeed with the minuteness
of miniature, but are crude in colour,
and drawn in lank and emaciated proportions.
It appears from his works, that he understood
the formation, had studied the expression,
and attempted the most picturesque attitudes
of animals. His name is well known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
antiquaries, and to the curious in coins, as a
medallist, and he has been celebrated as such
by many eminent pens of his own and the subsequent
century.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>From the crowd<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> of obscure contemporary
artists, which the neighbouring Vicenza produced,
the name of Marcello, or as Ridolfi calls
him Gio. Battista Figolino, deserves to be distinguished:
a man of original manner, whose
companion, in variety of character, intelligence
of keeping, landscape, perspective, ornament,
and exquisite finish, will not easily be discovered
at Venice, or elsewhere in the State, at
that period; and were it certain that he was
anterior to the two Bellini, sufficiently eminent
to claim the honours of an epoch in the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
of Art: in proof of which Vicenza may still
produce his Epiphany in the church of S<sup>t</sup>.
Bartolommeo.</p>

<p>But the man who had the most extensive
influence on Art, if not as the first artist, as the
first and most frequented teacher, was <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Francesco
Squarcione</span>,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> of Padova; in whose numerous
school perhaps originated that eclectic principle
which characterised part of the Adriatic
and all the Lombard schools. Opulent and
curious, he not only designed what ancient art
offered in Italy, but passed over to Greece,
visited many an isle of the Archipelago in
quest of monuments, and on his return to
Padova formed, from what he had collected, by
copy or by purchase, of statues, basso-relievos,
torsos, fragments, and cinerary urns, the most
ample museum of the time, and a school in
which he counted upwards of 150 students,
and among them Andrea Mantegna, Marco
Zoppo, Girolamo Schiavone, Jacopo Bellini.</p>

<p>Of Squarcione, more useful by precept than
by example, little remains, and of that little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
perhaps, not all his own. From the variety of
manner observable in what is attributed to him,
it may be suspected that he too often divided
his commissions among his scholars; such as
some stories of S<sup>t</sup>. Francis, in a cloister of his
church, and the miniatures of the Antifonario
in the temple della Misericordia, attributed
by the vulgar to Mantegna. Only one indisputably
genuine, though retouched work of
his, is mentioned by Lanzi; which, in various
compartments, represents different saints, subscribed
'Francesco Squarcione,' and conspicuous
for felicity of colour, expression, and
perspective.</p>

<p>These outlines of the infancy of Venetian art
show it little different from that of the other
schools hitherto described; slowly emerging
from barbarity, and still too much busied with
the elements to think of elegance and ornament.
Even then, indeed, canvass instead of panels
was used by the Venetian painters; but their
general vehicle was, a tempera, prepared water-colour:
a method approaching the breadth
of fresco, and friendly to the preservation of
tints, which even now retain their virgin purity;
but unfriendly to union and mellowness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
It was reserved for the real epoch of oil-painting
to develope the Venetian character, display
its varieties, and to establish its peculiar prerogative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tiziano</span>, the son of Gregorio Vecelli, was
born at Piave, the principal of Cadore on the
Alpine verge of Friuli, 1477.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> His education
is said to have been learned, and Giov. Battista
Egnazio is named as his master in Latin and
Greek;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> but his proficiency may be doubted,
for if it be true that his irresistible bent to
the art obliged the father to send him in his
tenth year to the school of Giov. Bellini at
Venice, he could be little more than an infant
when he learnt the rudiments under Sebastiano
Zuccati.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

in subtlety of touch even that hero of
minuteness: the hair of the heads and hands
may be counted, the pores of the skin discriminated,
and the surrounding objects seen reflected
in the pupils of the eyes; yet the effect
of the whole is not impaired by this extreme
finish: it increases it at a distance, which effaces
the fac-similisms of Albert, and assists the beauties
of imitation with which that work abounds
to a degree seldom attained, and never excelled
by the master himself, who has left it indeed
as a single monument, for it has no companion,
to attest his power of combining the extremes

<h4>GIACOMO ROBUSTI, SURNAMED IL TINTORETTO.</h4>

<h4>1512-1594.</h4>

<p class="p2">"It might almost be said that vice is the virtue
of the Venetian school, because it rests its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
prerogative on despatch in execution, and therefore
is proud of Tintoretto, who had no other
merit."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Such, in speaking of the great genius
before us, is the equally rash, ignorant, unphilosophic
verdict of a man exclusively dubbed
"The Philosophic Painter."</p>

<p>G. Robusti of Venice was the son of a dyer,
who left him that byname as an heir-loom.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
He entered the school of Tiziano when yet a
boy; but he, soon discovering in the daring
spirit of his nursling the symptoms of a genius
which threatened future rivalship to his own
powers, with that suspicious meanness which
marks his character as an artist, after a short
interval, ordered his head pupil, Girolamo
Dante, to dismiss the boy; but as envy generally
defeats its own designs, the uncourteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
dismissal, instead of dispiriting, roused the energies
of the heroic stripling, who, after some
meditation on his future course, and comparing
his master's superiority in <i>colour</i> with his defects
in <i>form</i>, resolved to surpass him by an union
of both: the method best suited to accomplish
this he fancied to find in an intense study of
Michael Angelo's style, and boldly announced
his plan by writing on the door of his study,
<span class="smcap">THE DESIGN OF M. ANGELO, AND THE COLOUR
OF TIZIAN</span>.</p>

<p>But neither form nor colour alone could
satisfy his eye; the uninterrupted habit of
nocturnal study discovered to him what Venice
had not yet seen, not even in Giorgione, if we
may form an opinion from what remains of
him&mdash;the powers of that ideal chiaroscuro
which gave motion to action, raised the charms
of light, and balanced or invigorated effect by
dark and lucid masses opposed to each other.</p>

<p>The first essays of this complicated system,
in single figures, are probably the frescoes of
the palace Gussoni;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and in numerous composition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the Last Judgement, and its counterpart,
the Adoration of the Golden Calf, in the
church of S<sup>ta</sup>. Maria dell' Orfo.</p>

<p>It is evident that the spirit of Michael Angelo
domineered over the fancy of Tintoretto
in the arrangement of the Last Judgement,
though not over its design; but grant some
indulgence to that, and the storm in which
the whole fluctuates, the awful division of
light and darkness into enormous masses, the
living motion of the agents, notwithstanding
their frequent aberrations from their centre of
gravity,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and the harmony that rules the whirlwind
of that tremendous moment, must for
ever place it among the most astonishing productions
of art. Its sublimity as a whole triumphs
even over the hypercriticisms of Vasari,
who thus describes it:&mdash;"Tintoretto has painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the Last Judgement with an extravagant
invention, which, indeed, has something awful
and terrible, inasmuch as he has united in
groups a multitudinous assemblage of figures
of each sex and every age, interspersed with
distant views of the blessed and condemned
souls. You see likewise the boat of Charon,
but in a manner as novel and uncommon as
highly interesting. Had this fantastic conception
been executed with a correct and regular
design, had the painter estimated its individual
parts with the attention which he bestowed
on the whole, so expressive of the
confusion and the tumult of that day, it would
be the most admirable of pictures. Hence
he who casts his eye only on the whole, remains
astonished, whilst to him who examines
the parts it appears to have been painted
in jest."</p>

<p>In the Adoration of the Golden Calf, the
counterpart in size of the Last Judgement,
Tintoretto has given full reins to his invention;
and here, as in the former, though their
scanty width does not very amicably correspond
with their height, which is fifty feet, he has
filled the whole so dexterously that the dimension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
appears to be the result of the composition.
Here too, as in the Transfiguration of Raffaelle,
some short-sighted sophist may pretend to discover
two separate subjects and a double action;
for Moses receives the tables of the decalogue
in the upper part, whilst the idolatrous ceremony
occupies the lower; but the unity of
the subject may be proved by the same argument
which defended and justified the choice
of Sanzio. Both actions are not only the offspring
of the same moment, but so essentially
relate to each other that, by omitting either,
neither could with sufficient evidence have told
the story. Who can pretend to assert, that
the artist who has found the secret of representing
together two inseparable moments of
an event divided only by place, has impaired
the unity of the subject?</p>

<p>Nowhere, however, does the genius of Tintoretto
flash more irresistibly than in the Schools
of S. Marco and S. Rocco, where the greater part
of the former and almost the whole of the latter
are his work, and exhibit in numerous specimens,
and on the largest scale, every excellence and
every fault that exalts or debases his pencil:
equal sublimity and extravagance of conception;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
purity of style and ruthless manner;
bravura of hand with mental dereliction; celestial
or palpitating hues tacked to clayey, raw,
or frigid masses; a despotism of chiaroscuro
which sometimes exalts, sometimes eclipses,
often absorbs subject and actors. Such is the
catalogue of beauties and defects which characterize
the Slave delivered by St. Marc; the
Body of the Saint landed; the Visitation of
the Virgin; the Massacre of the Innocents;
Christ tempted in the Desert; the Miraculous
Feeding of the Crowd; the Resurrection of
the Saviour; and though last, first, that prodigy
which in itself sums up the whole of Tintoretto,
and by its anomaly equals or surpasses
the most legitimate offsprings of art, the Crucifixion.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>
<p>It is singular that the most finished and best
preserved work of Tintoretto should be one
which he had least time allowed him to terminate&mdash;the
Apotheosis of S. Rocco in the principal
ceiling-piece of the Schola, conceived, executed,
and presented, instead of the sketch
which he had been commissioned with the rest
of the concurrent artists to produce for the
examination of the fraternity: a work which
equally strikes by loftiness of conception, a style
of design as correct as bold, and a suavity of
colour which entrances the eye. Though constructed
on the principles of that <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto in su</i>,
then ruling the platfonds and cupolas of upper
Italy, unknown to or rejected by M. Angelo,
its figures recede more gradually, yet with more
evidence, than the groups of Correggio, whose
ostentatious foreshortenings generally sacrifice
the actor to his posture.</p>

<p>That Tintoretto acquired, during his stay with
or after his dismissal from the study of Tiziano's
principles, the power of representing the surface
and the texture of bodily substance with a truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
bordering on illusion, is proved with more irresistible
because more copious evidence, in the
picture of the Angelic Salutation; though it cannot
be denied that the admiration due to the
magic touch of the paraphernalia is extorted at
the expense of the essential parts: Gabriel and
Maria are little more than foils of her husband's
tools; for their display, the artist's caprice has
turned the solemn approach of the awful messenger
into boisterous irruption, the silent recess
of the mysterious mother into a public dismantled
shed, and herself into a vulgar female.
Nowhere would the superiority of refined
over vulgar art, of taste and judgment over
unbridled fancy, have appeared more irresistibly
than in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">sopraporta</span> by Tiziano on the
same subject and in the same place, had that
exquisite master been inspired more by the
sanctity of the subject than the lures of courtly
or the ostentatious bigotry of monastic devotion.
If Maria was to be rescued from the
brutal hand that had travestied her to the
mate of a common labourer, it was not to be
transformed to a young abbess, elegantly devout,
submitting to canonization, amongst
her delicate lambs; if the angel was not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
rush through a shattered casement on a timid
female with a whirlwind's blast, the waving
grace and calm dignity of his gesture and attitude,
ought to have been above the assistance of
theatrical ornament; nor should Palladio have
been consulted to construct classic avenues for
the humble abode of pious meditation. It must
however be owned that we become reconciled
to this mass of factitious embellishments by a
tone which seems to have been inspired by
Piety itself; the message whispers in a celestial
atmosphere,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:4em;">
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θειη ἀμφεχυτ' ὀμφη</span>&mdash;</span>
</p>

<p class="p2b">and so forcibly appears its magic effect to have
influenced Tintoretto himself, ever ready to
rush from one extreme to another, that he
imitated it in the Annunciata of the Arimani
Palace:<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> not without success, but far below
the mannerless unambitious purity of tone
that pervades the effusion of his master, and
of which he himself gave a blazing proof in
the Resurrection of the Saviour,&mdash;a work in
which sublimity of conception, beauty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
dignity of form, velocity and propriety of motion,
irresistible flash, mellowness and freshness
of colour, tones inspired by the subject, and
magic chiaroscuro, less for "mastery strive,"
than relieve each other and entrance the absorbed
eye.</p>

proof of his attachment to the Florentine school, than by
building the fame of Pisano on having been the pupil of
Andrea del Castagno, and having been allowed to terminate
the works which he had left unfinished behind him about
1480; an anachronism the more absurd as the Commendator
del Pozzo was possessed of a picture by Pisano, inscribed
'<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Opera di Vittor Pisanello de San V. Veronese</span>, <span class="smcap">mccccvi</span>.'

if that can be called engraving which contents itself with
the mere enumeration of the parts, totally neglecting the
medium of that tremendous twilight which hovers over the
whole and transposes us to Golgotha. If what Ridolfi says
be true, that Tintoretto embraced the engraver when he

a MS. gloss in the Library at Gottingen, mentioned

the inscription set him at Correggio, viz. that
he died in 1534, aged forty. The honour of
his birth-place is allowed to Correggio, though
not without dispute.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> His father's name was
Pellegrino Allegri, according to Orlandi, countenanced
by Mengs. He was instructed in the
elements of literature, philosophy, and mathematics;
however doubtful this, there can be
no doubt entertained on the very early period
in which he must have applied to Painting.
The brevity of his life, and the surprising number
of his works, evince that he could not
devote much time to literature, and, of mathematics,
probably contented himself with what
related to perspective and architecture. On
the authority of Vedriani and of Scannelli,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Mengs and his follower Ratti make Correggio
in Modena the pupil of Franc. Bianchi Ferrari,
and in Mantoua of Andr. Mantegna, without
vouchers of sufficient authenticity for either:
the passage quoted by Vedriani from the chronicle
of Lancillotto, an historian contemporary
with Correggio, is an interpolation; and Mantegna,
who died in 1505, could not have been
the master of a boy who at that time was
scarcely in his twelfth year.</p>

<p>Some supposed pictures of Correggio at Mantoua,
in the manner of Mantegna, may have
given rise to this opinion. An imitation of
that style is visible in some whose originality
has never been disputed: such as in the St.
Cecilia of the Palace Borghese, and a piece in
his first manner of the Gallery at Dresden.</p>

<p>Father Maurizio Zapata, a friar of Casino,
in a MS. quoted by Tiraboschi, affirms that
the two uncles of Parmegianino, Michele and
Pier Stario Mazzuoli, were the masters of Correggio,&mdash;a
supposition without foundation; it
is more probable, though not certain, that he
gained the first elements from Lorenzo Allegri
his uncle, and not, as the vulgar opinion states,
his grandfather.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>Equal doubts prevail on his skill and power
of execution in architecture and plastic: the
common opinion is, that for this he was
beholden to Antonio Begarelli. Scannelli,
Resta, and Vedriani, pretend that Correggio,
terrified by the enormous mass and variety of
figures to be seen foreshortened from below
in the cupola of the Domo at Parma, had the
whole modelled by Begarelli, and thus escaped
from the difficulty, correct, and with applause.
They likewise tell in Parma, that by occasion of
some solemn funeral, many of those models were
found on the cornices of the cupola, and considered
as the works of Begarelli: hence they
pretend that Correggio was his regular pupil,
and as such finished those three statues which
a tradition as vague as silly has placed to his
account in Begarelli's celebrated composition of
the Deposition from the Cross in the church of
St. Margareta.</p>

<p>That either Correggio himself or Begarelli
made models for the cupola admits no doubt,
the necessity of such a process is evident from
the nature and the perfection of the work; but
there is surely none to conclude from it to that
of a formal apprenticeship in sculpture. He
who had arrived at the power of painting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
cupola at Parma, may without rashness be supposed
to have possessed that of making for his
own use small models of clay, without the instructions
of a master, especially in an age when
painting, sculpture, and architecture frequently
met in the same artist; and, as we have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
observed, when sketching in clay was a
practice familiar to those of Lombardy.</p>

<p>Correggio's pretended journey to Rome is
another point in dispute: two writers of his
century, Ortensio Landi and Vasari, reject it.
The first says<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Correggio died young without
having been able to visit Rome; the second
affirms that Antonio had a genius which
wanted nothing but acquaintance with Rome
to perform miracles. Padre Resta, a great
collector of Correggio's works, was the first
who opposed their authority.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> He pretends,
in some writing of his own, to have adduced
twelve proofs of Correggio's having twice visited
Rome, viz. in 1520 and 1530. But the allegations
of a crafty monk, a dealer in drawings
and pictures, cannot weigh against authorities
like those of Vasari and Landi. His conjectures
rest partly on some supposed drawings of Correggio's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
in his possession, from the Loggie of
the Vatican, and partly on an imaginary journey,
in which, he tells us, Correggio traversed
Italy incognito, and made everywhere copies,
which all had the good luck to fall into his own
reverend hands. These lures, held out to ensnare
the ignorant and wealthy, he palliated by
a pretended plan of raising a monument to the
memory of the immortal artist at Correggio, the
expenses of which were to be defrayed by the
produce of his stock in hand. He had even
face enough to solicit from that town an attestation
that their citizen had travelled as a journeyman
painter.</p>

<p>Mengs, and of course Batti, embrace the
same opinion. Mengs draws his conclusion
from the difference between Correggio's first
and second style, which he considers less as the
imperceptible progress of art than as the immediate
effect of the works of Raphael and Michel
Agnolo. Mengs was probably seduced to believe
in this visionary journey on the authority
of Winkelmann, who pretended to have discovered,
in the museum of Cardinal Albani, some
designs after the antique by Mantegna, Correggio's
reputed master. Bracci, in opposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
assert that Allegri was beholden to none but
himself for his acquirements, and appeals to a
letter of Annibale Carracci, who says that Correggio
found in himself those materials for
which the rest were obliged to extraneous help.
The words of Carracci, however, with all due
homage to the genius of Correggio and the
originality of his style, appear to refer rather to
invention and the poetic, than to the executive
part of his works.</p>

<p>If there be any solidity in the observation of
Mengs on Correggio's first manner, as a mixture
of Pietro Perugino's and Lionardo's style,
and of course not very different from Raphael's,
how comes it that in the works of his second
and best manner all resemblance to either, and
consequently to Raphael, disappears? The
simplicity of Raphael's forms is little beholden
to that contrast and those foreshortenings which
are the element of Correggio's style. Raphael
sacrificed all to the subject and expression; Correggio,
in an artificial medium, sacrifices all to
the air of things and harmony. Raphael speaks
to our heart; Correggio insinuates himself into
our affections by charming our senses. The essence
of Raphael's beauty is dignity of mind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
petulant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> that of Correggio's. Raphael's
grace is founded on propriety; Correggio's
on convenience and the harmony of the whole.
The light of Raphael is simple daylight; that
of Correggio artificial splendour. In short, the
history of artists scarcely furnishes characteristics
more opposite than what discriminate these
two. And though it may appear a paradox to
superficial observation, were it necessary to find
an object of imitation for Allegri's second and
best style, the artificial medium, the breadth of
manner and mellowness of transition, with the
enormous forms and foreshortenings of Michel
Angelo, though adopted by so different a
mind, from as different motives, for an end still
more different, will be found to be much more
congenial with his principles of seeing and executing,
than the style of any preceding or coetaneous
period.</p>

<p>The authenticity of Correggio's celebrated
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Anch' io son Pittore</span>," is less affected by the
improbability of his journey to Rome, than by
its own legendary weakness: though not at Modena
or Parma, for there were no pictures of
Raphael in either place during Antonio's life,
he might have seen the St. Cecilia at Bologna;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and if the story be true, perhaps no large picture
of that master that we are acquainted with
could furnish him with equal matter of exultation.
He was less made to sympathize with
the celestial trance of the heroine, the intense
meditation of the Apostles, and the sainted
grace of the Magdalen, than to be disgusted by
a parallelism of the whole which borders on
primitive apposition, by the total neglect of
what is called picturesque, the absence of chiaroscuro,
the unharmonious colour, and dry
severity of execution.</p>

<p>The next point is to fix the dates of Correggio's
works; the certain, the probable, the
conjectural.</p>

<p>The theatre of Correggio's first essays in art
is supposed to have been his native place
and the palace of its princes; but that palace
perished with whatever it might contain.
From a document in the parochial archive of
Correggio, of 1514, it appears that in the same
year he painted an altar-piece for one hundred
zechini, a considerable price for a young man
of twenty. This picture was in the church of
the Minorites, where it remained till 1638, when
a copy was unawares put into the place of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
original. The citizens alarmed, in vain made
representations to Annibale Molza, their governor;
it even appears from a letter of his to
the Court of Modena, in whose name he governed,
that, many years before, two other pieces
of Antonio had been removed from the same
chapel by order of Don Siro, the last prince
of the House of Correggio; those represented
a St. John and a St. Bartholomew; the subject
of the altar-piece was the Madonna with
the child, Joseph and St. Francis.</p>

<p>The fraternity of the Hospital <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">della Misericordia</span>
possessed likewise an altar-piece of Antonio.
The centre piece represented the Deity
of the Father; the two wings, St. John and
Bartholomew. According to a contract which
still remains in the archives, it was estimated by
a painter of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Novellara</span>, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Jacopo Borboni</span>, at three
hundred ducats, bought for Don Siro in 1613,
and a copy put in its place. The originals of
all these pictures are lost.</p>

<p>The picture with the Madonna and child on
a throne, St. John the Baptist, the Sts. Catharina,
Francis, and Antony, inscribed "Antonius
de Allegris P." now in the gallery of
Dresden, was, as Tiraboschi correctly supposes,
an altar-piece in the church of St. Nicolas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the Minorites, at Carpi: a copy of it by Aretusi,
is at Mantoua. To this period, and perhaps
even an earlier one, belongs the St.
Cecilia of the Borghese palace. The general
style of this picture is dry and hard, and the
draperies in Mantegna's taste; but the light
which proceeds from a glory of angels, and imperceptibly
expands itself over the whole, is a
characteristic too decisive to leave any doubt
of its originality.</p>

<p>In the gallery of Count Br&uuml;hl was the Wedding
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">sposalizio</span>) of St. Catharine, with the
following inscription on the back:&mdash;"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laus
Deo</span>: <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">per Donna Metilde d'Este Antonio
Lieto da Correggio fece il presente quadro
per sua divozione, anno 1517</span>." This inscription
appears, however, suspicious, as at that time
there was no princess of that name at the
court of Ferrara. At the purchase of the
principal pictures in the Modenese gallery by
Augustus III. this was presented by the Duke
to Count Br&uuml;hl; from him it went to the Imperial
Gallery at Petersburg. A similar one
was in the collection of Capo di Monte at
Naples, and Mengs considers both as originals.
Copies of merit by Gabbiani and Volterrano
are in England and Toscana. It is singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
that an artist, than whom none had more
scholars and copyists, and whose short life was
occupied by the most important works, should
be supposed to have painted so many duplicates,
and that a set of men, as impudent as
ignorant, should meet with dupes as credulous
as wealthy, eager to purchase their trash at
enormous prices, in the face of the few legitimate
originals.</p>

<p>In 1519, Antonio went to Parma, and soon
after his arrival is said to have painted a room
in the Nunnery of St. Paul. The authenticity
of this work, placed within the clausure of the
convent and consequently inaccessible, has been
recently disputed, and the author of a certain
dialogue even attempts to prove the whole a
fable. To ascertain the fact, a special licence
to visit the place was obtained for some painters
and architects of note, and on their declaring
the paintings one of Correggio's best works,
Don Ferdinando de Bourbon, with some of the
courtiers and Padre Iveneo Affo, followed to
inspect it. What he tells us of monastic constitution
in those times accounts for the admission
of so profane an ornament in such a
place; for in the beginning of the sixteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
clausure was yet unknown to nunneries;
abbesses were elected for life, their power over
the revenue of the convent was uncontrolled,
their style of life magnificent, and their political
influence not inconsiderable. Such was
the situation of nunneries when Donna Giovanna
da Piacenza, descended from an eminent
family at Parma, the new-elected abbess of St.
Paul's, ordered two saloons of her elegant
apartments to be decorated with paintings; one
by Correggio, and another, as it is conjectured,
either by Alessandro Araldi of Parma, or Cristoforo
Casella, called Temperello. Padre Affo
proves that Correggio must have painted his
apartment before 1520, immediately after his
arrival at Parma, and four or five years before
the introduction of the clausure. Of a work so
singular and questionable, it will not appear
superfluous to repeat some of the most striking
outlines from his account:&mdash;"The chimney-piece
represents Diana returned from the chase,
to whom an infant Amor offers the head of a
new-slain stag; the ceiling is vaulted, raised in
arches over sixteen lunettes; four on each side
of the walls; the paintings are raised about an
ell from the floor, and form a series of mythologic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and allegoric figures, which breathe the
simplicity, the suavity, and the decorum of
Art's golden age. Of these the three Graces
naked, in three different attitudes, offer a
charming study of female beauty, and a striking
contrast with the Parc&aelig; placed opposite;
the most singular subject is a naked female
figure, suspended by a cord from the sky,
with her hands tied over her head&mdash;her body
extended by two golden anvils fastened with
chains to her feet, floating in the attitude of
which the Homeric Jupiter reminds his Juno.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
The high-arched roof embowers the whole with
luxuriant verdure and fruit, and is divided into
sixteen large ovals, overhung with festoons of
tendrils, vine-leaves, and grapes, between which
appear groups of infant Amorini, above the
size of children, gamboling in various picturesque
though not immodest attitudes."</p>

<p>Neither the pretended inaccessibility of place,
nor the veil thrown by monastic austerity over
the profaneness of the subject, can sufficiently
account for the silence of tradition, and the obscurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
in which this work was suffered to linger
for nearly three centuries. Supposing it, on the
authorities adduced, to be the legitimate produce
of Correggio, and considering its affinity
to the ornamental parts of the Loggie in the
Vatican, it affords a stronger argument of
Allegri's having seen Rome, studied the antique,
and imitated Raphael, than any of those
that have been adduced by Mengs, who (with
his commentator D'Azara,) appears to have
been totally uninformed of it, notwithstanding
his familiarity at Parma with every work of
Correggio, his perseverance of inquiry and
eager pursuit of whatever related to his idol,
the influence he enjoyed at Court, and unlimited
access to every place that might be supposed
to contain or hide some work of art.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival at Parma, Antonio probably
received the commission of the celebrated
cupola of S. Giovanni, which he completed in
1524, as appears from an acquittance for the
last payment subscribed 'Antonio Lieto,' still
existing at Parma.</p>

<p>In the cupola he represented the Ascension of
the Saviour, with the Apostles, the Madonna,
&amp;c. and the Coronation of the Virgin on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
tribune of the principal altar, whose enlargement
in 1584 occasioned, with the destruction
of the choir, that of the painting: a few fragments
escaped; an exact copy had, however,
been provided before, by Annibale Carracci,
from which it was repainted on the same place
by Aretusi. The same church preserved two
pictures in oil of Correggio, the martyrdom of
St. Placidus and Flavia, and Christ taken from
the cross on the lap of his mother; both are
now (1802) in the collection of the Louvre.</p>

<p>The success of the cupola of S. Giovanni
encouraged the inspectors of the Domo to commit
the decoration of theirs to the same master.
Of their contract with him, the original
still remains in the archive of their chapter;
it was concluded in 1522, and amounted to
about one thousand zecchini, no inconsiderable
sum for those times, and alone sufficient
to do away the silly tradition of the artist's
mendicity. The decorations of the chapel,
next to the cupola, were distributed among
three of the best Parmesan painters at that
time, Parmegianino, Franc. Maria Rondani,
and Michael Angelo Anselmi. From all the
papers hitherto found, it appears, however, that
Correggio did not actually begin to paint the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
cupola before 1526: it represents the Ascension
of the Virgin, and without recurring to
an individual verdict, has received the sanction
of ages, as the most sublime in its kind, of all
that were produced before and after it; a work
without a rival, though now dimmed with
smoke, and in decay by time. These were the
two first cupolas painted entire, all former ones
being painted in compartments. Nothing occurs
to make us surmise that Correggio had partners
of his labour in these two works; for Lattanzio
Gambara of Brescia, mentioned by Rossi as his
assistant in the Domo, was born eight years
after Correggio's death.</p>

<p>During the progress of these two great works,
Correggio produced others of inferior size but
equal excellence; the principal of which are
the two votive pictures of St. Jerome, and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La
Notte</span>. That of St. Jerome represents the
Saint offering his Translation to the Infant
Christ, who is seated in his Mother's lap,
with St. Magdalen reclining on and kissing
his feet, and flanked by Angels. The commission
for this picture is said to have been given
in 1523, by Donna Briseide Colla, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
widow of Orazio or Ottaviano Bergonzi of
Parma, who in 1528 gave it as a votive offering
to the church of S. Antonio del Fuoco.
The price agreed on, was 400 lire; 40,000 ducats
were offered for it afterwards by the King of
Portugal; and the then Abbot of the convent
was on the point of concluding the bargain,
when the citizens of Parma, to prevent the
loss, applied to the Infante Don Philippo.
He ordered it in 1749 to be transposed from
S. Antonio to the Domo; there it remained
till 1756, when, on the application of a French
painter, expelled by the Canons for his attempt
to trace it, the Prince had it transferred under
an escort of twenty-four grenadiers to Colorno;
and from thence to the newly instituted academy,
where it remained till 1797, and now,
(1802,) with other transported works of Art,
glitters among the spoils of the Louvre.</p>

<p>The second picture known by the name of
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Notte</span>," represents the birthnight of the
Saviour, and was the commission of Alberto
Pratonieri, as appears from a writing dated in
1522, though it was not finished till 1527
according to Mengs, or 1530 as Fiorillo surmised,
when it was dedicated in the Chapel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Pratonieri of S. Prospero at Reggio: from
whence, 1640, it was carried to the gallery of
Modena, by order, of Duke Francesco I. and
from thence at length to that of Dresden.</p>

<p>A chapel in the church del S. Sepolcro
at Parma, possessed formerly the altar-piece
known by the name of "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Madonna della
Scodella</span>," because the Virgin, represented on her
flight to Egypt, holds a wooden bowl in her
hand: a figure, whom Mengs fancies the Genius
of the Fountain, pours water into it; and in
the back ground an angel, whose action and
expression he considers as too graceful for the
business, ties up the ass. This picture, he tells us,
was, thirteen years before the date in which he
wrote, nearly swept out of the panel by the barbarous
wash of a Spanish journeyman painter
who had obtained permission to copy it. It
is now in the Louvre, and how much of its
present florid colour is legitimate, must be
left to the decision of the committee "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de la
Restoration</span>."</p>

<p>If the most sublime degree of expression be
entitled to the right of originality, Mengs must
be followed in his decision on the Ecce Homo,
formerly in the Palace Colonna, without much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
anxiety whether it be the same that belonged
to the family of Prati at Parma, or that which
Agostino Carracci engraved.</p>

<p>The Madonna seated beneath a palm-tree,
bending in somnolently pensive contemplation
over the Infant on her lap, watched by an
Angel above her, and attended by a Leveret,
known by the name of "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Zingarella</span>" or
the Egyptian, from the sash round her head,
formerly in the gallery of Parma, and now
at Naples in that of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Capo di Monte</span>, has
suffered so much from a modern hand, that
little of the master remains but the conception.
Nearly a duplicate of it was presented by
Cardinal <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Alessandro Albani</span> to king Augustus
of Poland; but Mengs hesitates to pronounce
it an original.</p>

<p>In the period of these, about 1530, we may
probably place the two celebrated pictures of
Leda and Danae, than which no modern works
of art have suffered more from accident and
wanton or bigoted barbarity, or been tossed
about by more contradictory tradition.</p>

<p>If the subject that takes its name from Leda
be, as Mengs says, rather an allegory than a
fable, it alludes to what would aggravate even
the story of that mistress of Jupiter. The central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
figure represents a female seated on the
verge of a rivulet with a swan between her
thighs, who attempts to insinuate his bill into
her lips; but at her side, and deeper in the
water, is a tender girl, who with an air of innocence
playfully struggles to defend herself from
the attacks of another swimming swan; farther
on, a girl more grown up to woman, gazes,
whilst a female servant dresses her, with an air
of satiate pleasure after a swan on the wing,
that seems just to have left her; at some distance
appears half a figure of an aged woman,
draped, and with looks of regret. On the other
side of the principal group, the graceful form
of a full-grown Amor strikes the lyre, and two
Amorini contrive to wind some horn instruments.
The scene of all this is a charming
grove on the brink of a pellucid lake.</p>

<p>The second picture represents the daughter
of Acrisius, but with poetic spirit. The virgin
gracefully reclines on her bed; a full-grown
Cupid, perhaps a Hymen, lifts with one hand
the border of the sheet on her lap that receives
the celestial shower, whilst his other presents
the mystic drops to her enchanted glance: two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
Amorini at the foot of the bed try on a touchstone,
that, one of the golden drops, this, the
point of an arrow, and he, says Mengs, has
a vigour of character much superior to the
other, plainly to express, that Love proceeds
from the arrow, and its ruin from gold; he
likewise finds that the head and head-dress of
Danae are imitated from those of the Medicean
Venus.</p>

<p>Vasari, and after him Mengs with others,
tell that in 1530, Federigo Gonzaga, then
created Duke of Mantoua, intended to present
Charles the Fifth at the ceremonial of his coronation
with two pictures worthy of him, and
in the choice of artists gave the preference to
Correggio. From this, a correct inference is
drawn against that pretended obscurity in
which Correggio is said to have lingered; for
at that time Giulio Romano lived at the Court
of Mantoua, and Tizian was in the service of
the Emperor. Vasari is silent on the date of
the pictures, but he affirms that, at their sight,
Giulio Romano declared he had never seen a
style of colour approaching theirs. So far all
seems correct; but that they were actually presented
to Charles, sent to Prague, and after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
sacking of that city by Gustavus Adolphus, carried
to Stockholm, is unproved or erroneous. If
it is not likely that the Emperor, instead of
sending them to Madrid, the darling depository
of his other works of art, should have sent them
into a kind of exile to Prague, it is an error
to pretend they were removed from thence by
Gustavus Adolphus, who was slain at Lutzen
sixteen years before the Swedes sacked that city,
1648. The truth is, that these pictures were
not given to the Emperor, but placed in his
own gallery by the Duke, where they remained
till 1630, when the Imperial General Colalto
stormed Mantoua, sacked it, deprived it of
its cabinet of treasures, of the celebrated vase
since possessed by the House of Brunswick,
and transmitted its beautiful collection of pictures
to Prague, from whence by the event of
war we have mentioned, they became the property
of Queen Christina, at whose abdication,
when the whole was packing up for Rome,
the two pictures in question were discovered
in the royal stables, where they had served as
window-blinds, mutilated and despised. Whether
so unaccountable a neglect be imputable to
the Queen's want of taste, as Tessin asserts, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
accident, or, what is most unlikely, to her modesty,
cannot now be decided. They were repaired,
and at her demise left to Cardinal Azzolini,
of whose heirs they were purchased by
Don Livio Odescalchi, and by him left to the
Duke of Bracciano, were sold to the Regent of
France, whose son, from a whim of bigotry,
had the picture of the Leda cut to pieces in his
own presence, in which state Charles Coypel
requested and obtained it for his private study.
At his death it was vamped up, repieced, disposed
of by auction, and, at a high price, sold
to the King of Prussia. What became of the
Danae is matter of dispute.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The picture of Io embraced by Jupiter, inbosomed
in clouds, by a silent water in which a
stag quenches his thirst, was their companion:
a work to which the most lavish fame has done
no justice, and beyond which no fancy ever
soared. The Io shared a still more barbarous
fate. Not content with mangling her like the
Leda, the bigot prince burnt her head; and,
were it not for the beautiful duplicate which
fortune preserved in the Gallery of Vienna,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
should be reduced to guess at Correggio in the
fragments at Sans Souci, and the prints of Surregue
and Bartolozzi. The Imperial Gallery
possesses, likewise, the Rape of Ganymede, by
Correggio, of the same size with the Io; a
Mountain Scene; a full-grown Cupid, seen from
behind, with his head turned to the spectator,
shaping a bow, accompanied by a laughing and
a weeping infant, in struggling attitudes, which
was likewise sold by the heirs of Don Livio
Odescalchi, has equally exercised opinion. Vasari,
Tassoni, Du Bois, de St. Gelais, &amp;c. ascribe
it to Parmegiano; Mengs and Fiorillo, who
judge from the duplicate at Vienna, with
greater probability give it to Correggio. The
contrast of the attitudes is produced more by
na&iuml;vet&eacute; than affectation, the lines have more
simplicity than the style of Mazzuola admitted
of, and the colour more breadth. The conception
of the whole, whether the infants be the
symbols of successful and unsuccessful love, or
denote the dangers of love, or be simply children,
though not beyond the fancy of Parmegiano,
has more the air of a Correggiesque
conceit. Numberless copies were made after it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
some by Parmegiano himself, whose handling
may be recognized in the picture at Paris.</p>

<p>We are now arrived at those works of Correggio's
which cannot be fixed to a certain period.
Such are probably, in the Gallery of
Dresden, those known under the names of S.
Giorgio and S. Sebastiano, of both of which
Mengs gives a circumstantial account. He is,
however, mistaken when he imagines the last
to have been voted by the City of Modena after
a plague: the commission of it was given by
the fraternity of St. Sebastian.</p>

<p>The half-length portrait, formerly known at
Modena as that of Correggio's Physician, belongs
to the same doubtful period. Mengs,
though he praises the colour and the impasto of
it, is inclined to think it painted about the
time of his first Cupola, when he had not yet
sufficiently studied detail of forms and variety
of tints. The style resembles that of Giorgione,
but is less vivid, though of equal pasto, and
somewhat more limpid.</p>

<p>The last, though not least celebrated piece of
Antonio in this Gallery, is the small Meditating
Magdalena: of the pictures mentioned, it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
only one painted on copper, the rest are on
panel. It is little more than a palm in height,
and not quite a palm and a half long. It was,
with other small pictures, stolen out of the Gallery
in 1788, but soon recovered. The purchase
price, according to Mengs, when the Gallery
was disposed of, was 27,000 Roman crowns. It
has been copied by Albani, and, if we believe
Richardson, by Tizian.</p>

<p>Besides the spoils of Parma, there is now
(1802) in the Gallery of the Louvre, from the
former collection of Versailles, a picture representing
in half-length figures of natural size the
Wedding of St. Catherine, with a St. Sebastian,
and their Martyrdom in the distance. It does
not appear that Mengs ever saw more than some
good copy of it, or the prints engraved from it,
else his praise would have probably been nearer
to astonishment than admiration; and though
none would dare to repeat what he ventures to
say of the Magdalen's head in the St. Jerome,
it might safely be asserted, that perhaps no
other picture can boast to have united in the
same degree the tints of Tizian, the glow and
impasto of Giorgione, and the breadth of Guido,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
with that bloom of hue and suavity of manner
peculiar to Correggio.</p>

<p>This divine performance was presented by
Cardinal Barberino to Cardinal Mazarin, with
two others painted in water colours on canvass,
representing in allegoric figures the heroism of
Virtue and the debasement of Vice. The first,
in physiognomy and attitudes, abounds in what
is commonly called the grace of Correggio; the
second in picturesque energy and expression:
they are likewise placed among the collections
of the Louvre. An unfinished repetition of
the first in the House Doria Panfili at Rome,
is adduced by Mengs as a proof of Correggio's
intelligence in sketching, and the superiority
of his principle in the progress of a work.</p>

<p>Of two pictures in the Cabinet at Madrid,
the principal is that of Christ praying in the
Garden, with an Angel on high pointing to a
Cross and a Crown of Thorns on the ground,
scarcely discernible. The open but drooping
arms of the Saviour express his entire resignation
to the will of his Father. The most poetic
singularity of this picture is its chiaroscuro:
Christ receives his light from Heaven, the Angel
from Christ: at a distance on lower ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
and nearly evanescent, are the three Disciples
<i>in graceful and picturesque attitudes</i>, and farther
off, the approaching host of captors. At first
sight, the whole seems to be divided into two
masses only of light and darkness, but on inspection,
the ambient medium and the more
and less of distinctness in the objects as they
approach the light or recede from it, is divinely
expressed. There is a tale, which even Lomazzo
and Scanelli repeat, that Correggio
parted with this picture to his apothecary for
four scudi, which he owed him; that afterwards
it was sold for five hundred crowns to
Pirrho Count Visconti, who resold it for seven
hundred and fifty gold doubloons, to the Marchese
Camarena, Governor of Milan, by whom
it was bought in commission for Philip the
Fourth. Every day discovers some copy, or, if
you choose to believe those who wish to dispose
of them, some duplicate or triplicate of this
picture. Padre Resta possessed not one, but
four, all of which he insisted on being believed
in as originals: one on copper, another on
wood, which Lelio Orsi was said to have copied
on canvass; a third, likewise on panel but
somewhat worm-eaten, disposed of to Monsignor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
Marchetti, and a fourth again on copper.
Some of these are probably in England.</p>

<p>The companion of this picture is the Madonna
dressing the Infant, with Joseph planing
a board in the back-ground; a performance
though inferior in style to the former, not less
original from the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">pentimenti</span> still discoverable
in the two principal figures.</p>

<p>The Duke of Alba possesses of Correggio, in
figures somewhat less than Nature, Mercury
teaching Cupid to read in the presence of Venus.
Venus has the singular attribute of wings, and
of a bow in her left hand; and Mengs persuades
himself to discover in her forms a reminiscence
of an imitation of the Apollino, formerly in
the Villa Medici at Rome. The characteristic
excellence of the execution, and an evident
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">pentimento</span> in the arm of the Mercury, leave no
doubt of its having a better claim to originality
than the duplicates in France and Germany.
It formerly made part of the collection of
Charles the First, and Sandrart saw it in the
Palace of Whitehall, from whence it was purchased
by an ancestor of the Duke of Alba.</p>

<p>Not to waste time on conjectural works, we
finish this list with a picture formerly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
house Barberini, now supposed to be in England:
it is painted on panel, and represents from
the narrative of S. Marc, the young man who followed
our Saviour at the moment of his captivity,
but fled on being laid hold of, and left his
garment in the hands of the captors. Mengs
describes a duplicate of this picture, painted on
canvass, at his time in the hands of an Englishman
at Rome, and though, in his opinion, only
the study for the other, in the principal parts,
especially the figure of the youth, highly finished:
his expression, form and attitude, remind
the critic so strongly of the same in the eldest
son of the Laocoon, that he is persuaded they
are an imitation, though in a style more consonant
with Correggio's manner.</p>

<p>The cause and circumstances of his death we
are not acquainted with, since the idle tale has
been discarded which Vasari tells, of his perishing
in consequence of having carried home a
load of sixty <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">scudi</span> in copper, which he had received
in payment at Parma. He who considers
what strength would be required to carry
sixty crowns in <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">quattrini</span>, will find its confutation
in the tale itself; let it be added that the
extreme heat which is said to have aggravated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
the fatigue, and accelerated his death, is, even
in Italy, not coincident with the season in which
he must have taken the journey,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> as he died
on the fifth of March. The magnificence and
number of his commissions; the deference paid
to his powers in the face of rival artists, by the
very patrons of those men, or societies, that
might have saved expense by admitting concurrence;
the handsome, though not quite metropolitan
prices, which he received, and what
Mengs has observed, the expensive goodness of
his colours, of his panels, and canvasses&mdash;make
it not only extremely improbable that he should
have lived in the depressed circumstances, to
which vulgar tradition has sunk him; but add
an air of truth to the opinion of those who
thought him, if not opulent, yet nearer allied
to affluence than want.</p>

<p class="p2b">Correggio was a monument without a tomb;
but it appears strange that a century and a half
should have elapsed before the thought of
erecting him one occurred to the Senate and
citizens of his native place, and then was suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
to evaporate in ineffectual projects. The
boastful intentions of Padre Resta proved
equally nugatory: the tombstone set and inscribed
by Girolamo Conti still remains a solitary
offering to his genius:</p>

<p class="center">
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. O. M.<br />

</p>

<p class="p2">On such a face as Correggio's, physiognomy
might have established principles or drawn some
inferences from it, had not a perverse destiny
left us as ignorant of it, as of his complexion,
stature, character, and habits. Vasari's exertions
to obtain a portrait of him were not only
unsuccessful, but hopeless; and the profile
which is shown in the dome of Parma as his,
becomes inadmissible from the very name of
the artist to whom it is ascribed.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> The head
which found its way into the third and every
following edition of Vasari, has certainly nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
repugnant with the notions we may form
of his character, but age. Meditation, simplicity,
serenity, compose it. It is said to have
been copied from a picture not quite finished,
which appears to have the touch of Correggio,
and came from Sicily to Naples. He is represented
contemplating a design, the original of
which, report has placed at Vienna with Prince
Esterhazy. The portrait which is at Turin, in
the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vigna della Regina</span>," engraved by Valperga,
with the epigraph, in part hid by the
frame, but read by Lanzi "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antonius Corrigius</span>
f." (<i>i. e.</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fecit</span>) though by some believed
genuine, appears spurious from this very circumstance,
the large character of the letters
and the space they occupy; a manner of writing
often used to indicate the person painted,
never the painter. Another portrait, which
from Genoua is said to have been carried to
England, with the indorsed inscription "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dosso
Dossi dipinse questo ritratto di Antonio da Correggio</span>,"
fronts the Memorie of Ratti. Without
examining the authenticity of this inscription,
it is sufficient to observe, that Antonio da
Correggio is likewise the name of Antonio Bernieri,
a celebrated miniature painter, and fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
citizen of Allegri, whose date coincides
with that of Dosso, and whom there will be
occasion to mention again.</p>

<p>Of Correggio's numerous pretending imitators,
Lodovico Carracci appears to be the only
one who penetrated his principle. The axiom,
that the less the traces appear of the means by
which a work has been produced, the more it
resembles the operations of Nature, is not an
axiom likely to spring from the infancy of art.
The even colour, veiled splendour, the solemn
twilight; that tone of devotion and cloistered
meditation, which Lodovico Carracci spread
over his works, could arise only from the contemplation
of some preceding style, analogous
to his own feelings and its comparison with
Nature; and where could that be met with in a
degree equal to what he found in the infinite
unity and variety of Correggio's effusions?
They inspired his frescoes in the cloisters of
S. Michele in Bosco: the foreshortenings of the
muscular labourers at the hermitage, and of
the ponderous demon that mocks their toil; the
warlike splendour in the Homage of Totila; the
Nocturnal Conflagration of Monte Casino; the
wild graces of deranged beauty, and the insidious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
charms of the sister nymphs in the garden
scene, equally proclaim the pupil of Correggio.</p>

<p class="p2b">His triumph in oil is the altar-piece of St.
John preaching in a chapel of the Certosa at
Bologna, whose lights seem embrowned by a
golden veil, and the shadowy gleam of Valombrosa;
though he sometimes indulged in tones
austere, pronounced, and hardy: such is the
Flagellation of Christ in the same church, whose
tremendous depth of flesh-tints contrasts the
open wide-expanded sky, and less conveys
than dashes its terrors on the astonished sense.</p>

<p class="lecture">THE SCHOOL OF BOLOGNA.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Three</span> epochs divide the history of painting
in Bologna and the neighbouring districts. The
first is from its restoration to the time of Francesco
Raibolini, or Francia; the second reaches
from him to the Carracci, when it attained its
height, and gradually decayed in the variety of
deviations which mark the third.</p>

<p>Bologna, at an early period of the fifth century,
appears to have been considered as a
nursery of sciences and arts; the foundation of
its University is dated up to Petronius, its
bishop at that period; afterwards, under the
successive invasions of barbarians, when the
alternate prey of clerical and secular rapacity,
as a powerful republic, or oppressed by civic
usurpation, and at last reduced to a Papal province,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Bologna never lost its predilection for
sciences and arts.</p>

<p>Of the progress made in painting anterior to
the time of Cimabue, some monumental relics
still remain, though by far the greater part
were ignorantly destroyed at the beginning of
the last century. Some that escaped the whitewasher's
hand are ascribed to an artist who
marked his work with the letters <i>P.F.</i> Of
these, one which represents a Maria, is preserved
in the Church della Baroncella, and was
done about 1120. Two others are in the
Basilica of S. Stephano.</p>

<p>Baldi, a collector of antique pictures, in a
MS. quoted by Malvasia, mentions some of
<i>Guido da Bologna</i>, painted in 1178 and 1180,
and others executed by <i>Ventura da Bononia</i> in
1197. Of this last something still remains,
especially one picture with the date 1217, and
the inscription <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ventura pinsit</i>: and the name of
<i>Urso</i>, or <i>Ursone</i>, a contemporary of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Guido da
Siena</i>, is found on a picture inscribed <i>Urso f.
1226</i>; and some others ascribed to him have
dates of 1242 and 1244. In those times painting,
sculpture, architecture, chasing, were frequently
exercised by one man. A certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
<i>Manno</i>, contemporary with Cimabue, is mentioned
as the painter of a Madonna by Baldi,
and as the sculptor of Pope Bonifazio VIII.
by Ghirardacci who calls him likewise a goldsmith.
His dates are from 1260 to 1301.
Some remains or rather ruins of these masters
are still visible in the palace Malvezzi.</p>

<p>The age of Giotto and Dante gives Art an
air of greater certainty. Tradition and monument
go hand in hand. Franco of Bologna,
with his supposed master Oderigi of Gubbio,
are celebrated in the poet's poem of the Purgatory.
Franco was called to Rome by Bonifazio
VIII. to decorate the books and missals
of the Vatican library with miniature; and on
his return to Bologna founded a school which
numbered among its scholars <i>Vitale</i>, <i>Lorenzo</i>,
<i>Simone</i>, and <i>Jacopo d'Avanzi</i>, whose works,
especially what remains of the two last, make
it probable that Vasari is correct when he
asserts that Franco excelled in large as well as
in miniature painting. Michael Agnolo and
the Carracci are said to have been struck with
the fire of conception and the tone of colour
in the pictures still preserved of Simone and
Jacopo d'Avanzi, at the Madonna di Mezzaratta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
and to have advised a careful restoration
of the decaying parts. Simone, who loved to
paint the crucifix, from the number which he
executed obtained the surname of "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">de' Crocefissi</span>;"
and Jacopo, smitten with the love of
Maria, was marked by the title "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">dalle Madonne</span>."
He excelled, however, in subjects of
a martial kind, if the conflict in the Chapel
of S. Jacopo del Santo at Padova, and the
Capture of Jugurtha, with the Triumph of
Marius, in a saloon at Verona, be his performances:
works which excited the wonder
of Mantegna. As he sometimes subscribed
"Jacobus Pauli," it has been surmised that he
was of Venetian extraction, and perhaps the
son and assistant of that Paolo who painted
the Ancona of S. Marc.</p>

<p>Of the artists who at that period painted
in Mezzaratta, Cristoforo, whether of Ferrara,
Modena, or Bologna, for he is claimed by all,
seems to have shared the highest repute. He
had the commission of the principal altar, where
he painted on panel the Madonna with the
Infant between her knees, and some figures
kneeling before her; it still exists, marked
with his name Christofano, 1380. A most
copious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span> work of his, divided into ten compartments
of saints, rudely designed, languid in
colour, but of original style, is preserved among
the fragments of the house Malvezzi.</p>

<p>Lippo di Dalmatio,&mdash;who was supposed to
have been a Carmelite, till Bianconi, in Piacenza's
edition of Baldinucci, produced proofs
of his wife and family,&mdash;came from the school of
Vitale, and from his predilection for the Mother
of Christ acquired, like Jacopo d'Avanzi, the
byname of "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lippo dalle Madonne</span>." There
goes a tale that he gave instruction to Saint
Catherine Vigri, of whom certain miniatures
and an Infant Christ on panel still remain.
A better union of tints, and some easier
arrangement in the folds of his draperies,
though with a profusion of gold lace, is all
that discriminates him from the crudeness and
exility of the ancient style. Such, however,
was his felicity in the character of Madonnas,
that they captivated Guido Reni,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> who
used to repeat that Lippo, in expressing at
once the majesty, the sanctity, and the mildness
of the divine mother, must have been
assisted by a celestial power. Some of these
Madonnas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span> are said to be in oil colours, with
dates of 1376, 1405, and 1407. Guido is
likewise the guarantee of certain frescoes representing
facts of Elia, painted with great
spirit by the same master.</p>

<p>After 1409, the last date of Lippo's pictures,
the School of Bologna somewhat declined, nor
could it be otherwise: no vigorous school ever
sprang from the timid precepts of a portrait
painter, and Dalmatio possessed more of that
than of historic power: this, rather than the
supposed imitation of certain images imported
from Constantinople, was the cause of that insignificance
which consigned, with few exceptions,
his school and successors to oblivion. Of
Pietro Lianori, Michele di Matteo, Bombologno,
Severo and Er&ccedil;ole Bologna, Catherina
di Vigri, Giacopo Ripanda, Marco Zoppo,
time has left little but the names, and of that
little, enough not to regret the loss of what
vanished. Let us not, however, be too fastidious
to repeat what tradition has persevered
to report of some; if Bombologno may be left
to the votaries of the crucifix, and Catherina to
the rubric that saints her, Michele Lambertini
claims the attention of artists for a mellowness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
of tints which Albano judged superior to the
tints of Francia; Giacopo Ripanda for the dangers
which he braved in designing the groups
of the Trajan pillar;<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and Marco Zoppo as no
despicable competitor of Andrea Mantegna, and
the reputed master of Francesco Francia.</p>

<p>Francesco Raibolini, surnamed Francia, born
in 1450, may be considered as the head of the
Bolognese school, because his works appear to
have been framed on that collective principle
which became its leading feature in the sequel,
and was probably the result of the long theory
that preceded his practice, assisted by that
readiness in design which distinguished him
as a goldsmith, chaser,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and die-cutter, professions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
to which he had been trained up from
his infancy, and which he raised to celebrity before
he attained complete manhood.</p>

<p>Francia was fortunate in contemporaries; the
School of Squarcione had furnished him with
style and form; the genius of Lionardo da Vinci,
with effect and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaroscuro</span>; Pietro Vanucchi
with arrangement if not composition, and
though not beauty, with amenity of aspect; and
Bellino with tone, breadth of drapery and colour.
Ardour of mind, energy of application and
dexterity, supplied the want of early practice,
and we find him in the palace of Giov. Bentivoglio
on a par with the most expert <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Frescanti</span>
conscribed from Ferrara and Modena, and soon
after intrusted with the commission of painting
the altar-piece of his chapel at S. Jacopo, a
work of great subtlety of execution; though
modestly inscribed "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Opus Francia Aurificis</span>,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
and a pledge of that superior style at which he
aimed and in the sequel attained.</p>

<p class="p2b">If from what has been premised of Bolognese
artists anterior to Cimabue, it is evident that
the germs of art belong to their own soil, their
claim to originality in the progress of style has
been and still is matter of dispute between the
champions of the Tuscan school and those of
their own. The Florentines insist on having
taught the Bolognese, what the Bolognese deny
to have learnt from the Florentines.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> As in a
dispute of this kind, candour is often sacrificed
to the fervour of patriotic vanity, and the obstinacy
of local attachment, the real state of the
question is better learnt from those monuments
of the fourteenth century, which still remain
scattered over Romagna or collected and more
classically arranged in Bologna itself. Among
all these some specimens will be found evidently
Greek, others as evidently Giottesque; some
in a Venetian style, and not a few in a manner
peculiar to Bologna only. These have a body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
colour, a taste in perspective, a mode of design
in figures, and a choice of forms and hues in draperies,
which no other school practised. From
all which it appears, that if Giotto during his
stay at Bologna raised pupils, and formed imitators,
his own school had no influence on, nor
dislodged, that aboriginal one which continued
to disseminate and to improve the principles
imbibed from the antique mosaics and the painters
of miniature.</p>

<p>The assertion that Niello was unknown to the ancients,
it is unnecessary to refute here. Francia was master of the
mint during the usurpation of the Bentivogli, after their
expulsion by Giulio the Second, and continued to superintend
its issue to the Pontificate of Leo. His coins and medals
are said by Vasari to equal those of the Milanese Caradosso;
and it is probably for their excellence that he was
looked up to as a god (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">un Dio</span>) at Bologna.</p></div>

<p class="tp3">TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES</p>

<p>Obvious typos have been silently corrected.</p>

<p>Idiosyncratic spellings have been left unchanged. This includes
inconsistent spellings of proper names, hyphenated words, oe ligatures and capitalisation.</p>

<p>For example: Julio Pipi on p. 118 and Giulio Pippi on p. 361.</p>

<p class="p2b">Similarly, the spellings "domo" and "duomo" both appear, and have been
left unchanged.</p>

<p class="p2b">There are numerous Greek quotations, in which accents and smooth
breathings are used only occasionally, and rough breathings are nearly
always marked. Missing accents and breathings have NOT been added.</p>

<p>The following items are worth special note:</p>

<p class="pinset">1) The phrase "terribil via" on p. 19 should possibly be "terribilis
via" or "terribile via", but has been left unchanged.</p>

<p class="pinset">2) On p. 28 "Goliah" has been amended to "Goliath", but the spelling
"Goliah" also appears in vol. 2 and may have been an accepted spelling.</p>

<p class="pinset">3) In footnote 96 on p. 264, "Osteireichischen" has been amended to
"Osterreichischen".</p>

<p class="pinset">4) On p. 265, "seini" has been amended to "sein".</p>

<p class="pinset">5) "Matatona" on p. 328 should possibly be "Matalona", as on p. 288, but
has been left unchanged.</p>

<p class="pinset">6) On p. 330, "Buoancorsi" has been amended to "Buonacorsi".</p>

<p class="pinset">7) The phrase "sotto in s&ugrave;" (page 357) has been amended to match "sotto
in su", which appears twice elsewhere.</p>

<p class="pinset">8) The spelling "pinsit" instead of "pinxit" on p. 400 has been retained
as it may record an error in the original inscription.</p>
